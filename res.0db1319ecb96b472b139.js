This spell has two purposes, and you choose which application to use at the time of casting.  \n  \n_Combat Corruption_: Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that corruption’s Progression section), it advances to the next corruption stage—at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this spell can lower the target’s corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn’t at progression stage of 1 or higher.  \n  \n_Remove Corruption_: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of _alleviate corruption_ doesn’t reduce the target’s corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.  \n  \nEither application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target’s manifestation level + 3 times the target’s corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).  \n  \nTampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it. Casting _alleviate corruption_ on yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it).

You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you’re carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn’t duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.  \n  \nYou perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don’t find them disorienting.  \n  \nWhen you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell, you can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can’t also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn’t take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn’t move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.  \n  \nThe two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same [_fireball_](/spells/fireball), you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by [_hold person_](/spells/hold-person), both would become paralyzed on a failed save. Both bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can’t be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don’t count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.  \n  \nAny magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you’re bilocating. For example, the [_hold person_](/spells/hold-person) spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds’ worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared. If you were under an _eagle’s splendor_ effect that had 1 minute remaining when you cast _bilocation_, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.  \n  \nWhen the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate.

For each assistant who casts [_dominate animal_](/spells/dominate-animal), [_dominate person_](/spells/dominate-person), or [_dominate monster_](/spells/dominate-monster), your caster level for this casting of _binding_ increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the _binding_ spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All _binding_ spells are dismissible.  \n  \nRegardless of the version of _binding_ you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.  \n  \nIf you cast any of the first three versions of _binding_ (those with limited durations), you may cast additional _binding_ spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all _binding_ spells it has received are broken.  \n  \nThe _binding_ spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.  \n  \n_Chaining_: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an [_antipathy_](/spells/antipathy) spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of _binding_ is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.  \n  \n_Slumber_: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of _binding_ is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.  \n  \n_Bound Slumber_: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.  \n  \n_Hedged Prison_: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.  \n  \n_Metamorphosis_: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The _binding_ is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.  \n  \n_Minimus Containment_: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The _binding_ is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.  \n  \nYou can't dispel a _binding_ spell with [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) or a similar effect, though an [_antimagic field_](/spells/antimagic-field) or [_mage's disjunction_](/spells/mage's-disjunction) affects it normally.

This wall provides total cover to all Large or smaller creatures and objects. The barrier can only spring up in an area of natural, unworked ground. The energy that forms the wall’s matrix is unstable, and you must concentrate to maintain the wall’s shape. A _blast barrier_ has an AC of 9, hardness 0, and 5 hit points per caster level. When a _blast barrier_ reaches 0 hit points, or when you cease concentrating on maintaining it, the energies that maintain the barrier’s shape fail with explosive results, sending sharp chunks of the materials comprising the wall and magical energy out along both sides. Any creature that is adjacent to a _blast barrier_ when it explodes takes 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of sonic damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 6d6). A successful Reflex save halves the total damage done. Spell resistance applies as well.  \n  \nThis instability can make using a _blast barrier_ risky, but many of the spellcasters that pioneered the spell became experts at its tactical applications, often using the barriers to cover an escape while lobbing spells and parting shots, hoping to trigger the barrier’s destruction just as their would-be pursuers approached."},{name:"Blast of Wind",source:"[_Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 17_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qyb?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Elemental-Masters-Handbook)",school:"evocation",descripters:["air"],levels:["arcanist 4","druid 4","hunter 4","sorcerer 4","wizard 4"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S"],range:"60 ft.",effect:"line-shaped blast of hurricane-force wind emanating out from you to the extreme of the range",duration:"1 round",savingThrow:"Fortitude negates",spellResistance:"yes",description:"With a spiraling gesture of your hand and a forceful exhalation, you create a brief but fierce (90 mph) blast of wind.

If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).  \n  \nIf the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.  \n  \nAny individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).  \n  \nWhile blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.  \n  \nYou take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.  \n  \nWhile blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.  \n  \nSince you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.  \n  \nAn ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.  \n  \nAn ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.  \n  \nForce effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.

A deadfall over a 10-foot square deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 7d6), a deadfall over a 15- foot square deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 5d6), and so on, to a maximum size of a 25- foot square. Only creatures that are on the outer edge of the area affected by a conjure deadfall spell can attempt Reflex saves to avoid the effect; creatures whose space does not touch the edge of the deadfall do not receive a save.  \n  \nIn order to deal damage, the conjured deadfall must start at least 10 feet above the tallest creature in the area to be affected. A conjured deadfall is as tall as it is wide, and the spell fails if you attempt to conjure a deadfall in an area already occupied by a creature or object (including the ceiling).

You can’t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar _contact entity_ spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication.

Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn’s overwhelming mind).

You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.  \n  \n_Bountiful_: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner.

By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.  \n  \n_Structure_: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on.

A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits.  \n  \n_Magic_: Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait (see Magic Traits, _GameMastery Guide_ 187). If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as “effects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire” or “death spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.” A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.  \n  \n_Morphic_: You may use [_move earth_](/spells/move-earth) at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell’s normal casting time, and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes).

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell.  \n  \nWhen you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The “walls” and “ceiling” of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane’s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane’s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.  \n  \nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane’s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use [_move earth_](/spells/move-earth) to create a hill or [_wall of stone_](/spells/wall-of-stone) to create a barricade.  \n  \nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as [_astral projection_](/spells/astral-projection), [_etherealness_](/spells/etherealness), or [_plane shift_](/spells/plane-shift). You are considered “very familiar” with your entire demiplane.  \n  \nAs a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using [_limited wish_](/spells/limited-wish), _mage’s disjunction_, [_miracle_](/spells/miracle), or [_wish_](/spells/wish) and making a successful dispel check.  \n  \nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two.  \n  \nYou can make this spell permanent with the [_permanency_](/spells/permanency) spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp.

You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it’s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can’t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.  \n  \nYou designate where both you and your subject appear. You don’t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can’t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it’s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don’t realize they’re in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.  \n  \nMore creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the [_mindscape door_](/spells/mindscape-door) spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape, but you’re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.  \n  \nAs is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.  \n  \nIf you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it’s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn’t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.  \n  \nThis spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by _dispel magic_. _Dispel magic_ can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the _dispel magic_ can take effect.  \n  \nYou choose to use _dispel magic_ in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.  \n  \n_Targeted Dispel_: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.  \n  \nFor example, a 7th-level caster casts _dispel magic_, targeting a creature affected by [_stoneskin_](/spells/stoneskin) (caster level 12th) and [_fly_](/spells/fly) (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the [_stoneskin_](/spells/stoneskin) (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the [_fly_](/spells/fly) (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the [_stoneskin_](/spells/stoneskin) would have been dispelled, leaving the [_fly_](/spells/fly) intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.  \n  \nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a [_wall of fire_](/spells/wall-of-fire)). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.  \n  \nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by _summon monster_), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.  \n  \nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.  \n  \nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.  \n  \n_Counterspell_: When _dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, _dispel magic_ may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.\n\n#### Mythic Dispel Magic\n\n**Source** [_Mythic Adventures pg. 92_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures)  \nWhen used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one.

When trying to locate the dreamscape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct dreamscape.  \n  \n**On Target**: You travel to the correct creature’s current dreamscape.  \n  \n**Off Target**: You travel to an area near the target dreamscape on the Ethereal Plane.  \n  \n**Other Dreamscape**: You travel to a similar creature’s dreamscape on the Dimension of Dreams.  \n  \n**Mishap**: You and anyone else traveling with you experience a mishap during travel; each character takes 1d10 points of damage and must reroll on the table to see where it ends up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the travelers take more damage and must reroll to see where they end up.  \n  \nRegardless of the accuracy of your _dream travel_, you and your companions all arrive at the same location (except in the case of a mishap). Mindless creatures can’t use _dream travel_, nor can creatures that can’t dream.  \n  \nYou might be able to exit the dream near the creature on its home plane. If you and the other creatures are still in a dream when the dreamer wakes up, the dreamer can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another dreamscape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the dreamer awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.  \n  \nYou can use _dream travel_ to travel to the dream of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the dreams of outsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination dream, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomes shaken for the remainder of the _dream travel_ and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using _dream travel_ to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply.  \n  \n\n<table class="inner"><tbody><tr><td><b>d6</b></td><td><b>Result</b></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Creature contracts cackle fever or mindfire (equal chance of either; see page 557 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Creature is cursed, as <i>bestow curse</i>; if the creature is a spellcaster, it instead acquires a random minor spellblight (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 94).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Creature is attacked by a <i>phantasmal killer</i>, and is treated as having failed the initial saving throw to disbelieve it. The Fortitude save DC is equal to the Will save DC that the creature failed.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Creature is possessed as <i>possession</i> (see page 181) by an outsider (50% chance to be a creature from the destination plane; otherwise, it is a random hostile outsider).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Creature is affected as <i>feeblemind</i>.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Creature is affected as <i>insanity</i>.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n  \nTraveling to a different planar destination decreases the accuracy of your dream transit. If you exit a creature’s dream onto a plane different from the plane you started on, you end up in a random location on the destination plane.  \n  \nIf the target of your _dream travel_ isn’t dreaming, you and the other travelers can wait on the Dimension of Dreams until that creature begins sleeping. For each hour that passes during this wait, each dream traveler must attempt a Will save as if it were traveling to reach another plane.'},{name:"Dream Voyage",source:"[_Occult Adventures pg. 167_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures)",school:"conjuration",subschool:"teleportation",descripters:["mind-affecting"],levels:["psychic 9"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S"],range:"touch",target:"you and one creature/level",duration:"1 hour/level (D)",savingThrow:"Will negates",spellResistance:"yes",description:"This spell functions as [_dream travel_](/spells/dream-travel), but you and your companions travel through the Dimension of Dreams in a fantastical vehicle of your own devising that halves the travel time. Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren’t inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to harmful emotion and fear effects. Unlike with [_dream travel_](/spells/dream-travel), there is no chance the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However, if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you do need to roll, using the false identity entry from [_dream travel_](/spells/dream-travel).  \n  \nCreatures that disembark from your vehicle can either enter the dreamscape or exit to the plane where the dreamer’s body lies, arriving within 1 mile of the dreamer’s body. All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The dreamer can’t prevent the dream voyagers from entering its dream, but can attempt a Will save to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.  \n  \nThe psychic vehicle remains in the dream for the remainder of the spell’s duration, even if it’s unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the dreamer can reenter the dream vessel as a full-round action through an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast _dream voyage_ to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the dream again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell’s duration. If the vessel moves out of a dreamscape, companions left behind can’t return to the vessel by being near the dreamer. If a companion is killed, its body doesn’t return to the _dream voyage_ unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.  \n  \nIf the dreamer awakens while the dream vessel is still in its dream, it can allow the dream travelers to exit or not (as with [_dream travel_](/spells/dream-travel)). The dream vessel remains intact in the Dimension of Dreams for the spell’s duration even if it’s untethered from a dream. It drifts through dreams when this happens, and you can’t pilot it to another dream (even a dream of the initial dreamer if that creature begins dreaming again). If you dismiss the spell at any time, you and all subjects within the dream vessel return to where you started on the Material Plane.  \n  \nYou can increase the number of companions you can bring on a _dream voyage_ to 10 creatures per caster level, though to do so you must increase the casting time, maintaining your concentration and touching up to 6 creatures per round as a fullround action. If your concentration is disrupted before you touch all of the targets, the spell is wasted and has no effect. Once you have touched all of your companions, the _dream voyage_ begins; however, its duration is reduced to 1 hour."},{name:"Drench",source:"[_Paizo Blog - Ultimate Cantrips pg. 0_](http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lc7e)",school:"conjuration",subschool:"creation",descripters:["water"],levels:["arcanist 0","sorcerer 0","wizard 0"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S"],range:"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)",target:"one creature or object of size Large or smaller",duration:"1 round",savingThrow:"Reflex negates (object)",spellResistance:"yes (object)",description:"A sudden downpour soaks the target creature or object.

You could, for example, make stab wounds close up as though they were never there, rearrange bruises on the neck, evaporate traces of poison within the body into nothingness, make burn marks grow to cover the corpse’s skin, or shrivel the target’s body as though the creature had starved.

A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.

An _earthquake_ cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.  \n  \n_Cliffs_: _Earthquake_ causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).  \n  \n_Open Ground_: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Environment for more details).  \n  \n_Structure_: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).  \n  \n_River, Lake, or Marsh_: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.  \n  \n_Pinned Beneath Rubble_: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.

Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception check to notice it.  \n  \nYou may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own body’s surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action.  \n  \nWhen you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance. Portraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image.  \n  \nYou may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it.

They often follow adventuring parties traveling through their lands, listening in on campfire tales and occasionally challenging proud warriors to duels. A warrior who claims victory with honor (while enduring the little fey’s attempts to even the odds) might earn the atomie’s boon. In other cases, a storyteller who enraptures the atomie with tales of glory might be granted this gift, especially if she strokes the little warrior’s ego in the process.  \n  \nAtomies liberally use their bane in order to gain an edge in their duels or to hinder attackers. Fortunately for their targets, the curse is as short-lived as the atomie’s attention span.  \n  \n**Boon**: You treat any weapon you wield as though it were masterwork, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls. If you wield a weapon that is already masterwork, you instead gain a +1 enhancement bonus on damage rolls. This boon has a duration of 1 hour per caster level (6 hours for a typical atomie).  \n  \n**Bane**: You treat any weapon you wield as though it were sized for a wielder one size category smaller than you. This reduces the weapon’s damage die type appropriately and causes you to take a –2 penalty on attack rolls. The weapon’s actual size and amount of effort required to use it (light, one-handed, or two-handed) do not change. This bane has a duration of 24 hours.  \n\n#### Dryad\n\nWhen a dryad’s tree comes under threat from lumberhungry settlements or bands of evil humanoids, the treebound fey might seek aid from kindly heroes. A dryad might offer her boon as an incentive, as it allows these protectors to retreat to her side to regroup if necessary. Even when no threat is present, a dryad might become infatuated with a comely humanoid who stumbles upon her isolated grove, granting her boon to her lover so that they can reunite with ease.  \n  \nThe fastest way to rouse a dryad’s anger is to threaten her tree or the trees of her forest (although some dryads permit limited woodcutting of nearby trees, if performed respectfully), yet the good-hearted fey rarely curse those who are not obviously malicious. On occasion, those transformed into trees by the dryad’s bane are reborn as dryads themselves; such fey combine most of their former skills with a dryad’s heart, making them fierce protectors of their tree’s domain.  \n  \n**Boon**: You gain the druid’s woodland stride ability. If you already have that ability, you instead move normally through magically manipulated terrain effects and gain a +10-foot bonus to your land speed while in forest terrain. This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (6 days for a typical dryad). You can step into any tree with a girth at least equal to yours and transport yourself to the dryad’s tree, as per [_tree stride_](/spells/tree-stride), but doing so immediately ends the boon’s effects.  \n  \n**Bane**: You take 1d2 points of Dexterity drain each morning as your flesh slowly transforms into wood. If this bane is removed, all Dexterity drain you have accumulated from this bane immediately disappears. If this bane reduces your Dexterity score to 0, you transform into a full-grown, mundane oak tree, taking root in your present location and potentially damaging structures or floors in the process. This bane is permanent.  \n\n#### Huldra\n\nFox-tailed huldras are wild and impulsive, but their boon is not lightly granted. Aiding a huldra against hostile foes might earn her favor, but opportunities to do so are uncommon; the deceptively strong fey are no damsels in distress. An amorous huldra might offer her boon to her lover while her passions are high, but woe betide the paramour who behaves as though entitled to her gifts. More thoughtful huldras, aware of the transformation their boon causes and their own shyness regarding their tails, consult with potential recipients before granting a boon; most, though, grant it without a second thought.  \n  \nThe easiest way to anger a huldra is to draw attention to her tail or mention her race’s rumored links to trollkind—most huldras consider their bane perfect for punishing such impropriety. Huldras are capricious, however, and a heartfelt apology might persuade a huldra to undo her fey curse. A huldra resents attempts made to constrain her travels, and may bestow her bane upon any who impinge upon her inviolable right to wander the land. Huldras rarely curse foes during combat, save as a final act of vengeance when the battle is lost.  \n  \n**Boon**: You grow a foxlike tail like that which a huldra has. This tail is infused with supernatural strength and you can use it as a primary natural weapon that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (1d4 for a Small creature). This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (4 days for a typical huldra).  \n  \n**Bane**: Your body warps into a troll-like appearance, becoming rangy, potbellied, and profoundly ugly. At the same time, your personality becomes oafish and dull. Your Charisma score is reduced by an amount equal to the bane’s caster level (to a minimum of 6). This bane is permanent.  \n\n#### Lampad\n\nDue to their sullen, moody demeanors and their general perception of surface races as greed-driven strip miners, lampads rarely grant their gifts to others. A lampad’s boon is most often granted to those miners who graciously ask the cave-maid’s permission to mine the earth, and who further promise to honor the stone by leaving carvings and artful designs in exchange for its bounty of jewels and metal. Additionally, those who defend the sanctity of the lampad’s caves might earn her boon. In any case, though, demanding a reward from the lampad elicits only a sulky refusal.  \n  \nA lampad does not hesitate to use her bane in combat against those undeterred by her insane beauty or supernatural weeping. Those who flagrantly disrespect the cave-maid or her home might suffer her curse as well. Lampads rarely inflict their bane upon otherwiseinnocent miners or adventurers, but the fickle fey have little patience for those who insist on outstaying their welcome. When a lampad has acted hastily in cursing an interloper due to some misunderstanding, she can be convinced to revoke her bane, although respect and diplomacy are key.  \n  \n**Boon**: You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet and the dwarf ’s stonecunning racial trait. In addition, when you’re underground in unworked caverns, the stone around you speaks to you, warning you of danger and granting you a +1 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saving throws. This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (7 days for a typical lampad).  \n  \n**Bane**: You constantly weep streams of thick tears, impairing your vision. You treat all other creatures as if they had concealment, and spells you cast that require line of sight have a 20% spell failure chance. This bane is permanent.\n\n#### Leprechaun\n\nLeprechauns love mischief in all its forms. A leprechaun who crosses paths with a fellow trickster may grant his boon, hoping to spread mischief without having to do the legwork or put his own neck on the line. In such cases, the leprechaun often follows the boon’s recipient invisibly for a time, hoping for a demonstration of tomfoolery; failure to provide a good show might force the leprechaun to make his own fun at the recipient’s expense. While rumor suggests that capturing a leprechaun might earn its boon, the fey is more likely to secretly curse his captor instead.  \n  \nMuch like atomies, leprechauns make liberal use of their bane to embarrass or frustrate their targets. A leprechaun might even offer a “solution” to remove the curse it inflicted, usually something embarrassing, such as bathing naked in the town fountain at noon. Of course, the supposed solution does nothing about the curse unless the leprechaun is sufficiently amused to remove it.  \n  \n**Boon**: The First World’s illusions are at your command. You can use the following spell-like abilities three times each: [_dancing lights_](/spells/dancing-lights), [_disguise self_](/spells/disguise-self), [_ghost sound_](/spells/ghost-sound), [_major image_](/spells/major-image) (visual and auditory elements only), and [_ventriloquism_](/spells/ventriloquism). Their caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. This boon lasts until you have expended all the spell-like abilities or after 1 week, whichever is sooner.  \n  \n**Bane**: Your mundane possessions crumble in times of stress or need. Whenever you roll initiative, you must succeed at a Fortitude save (with a DC equal to the DC of the [_fey blight_](/spells/fey-blight) spell-like ability) or one of your nonmagical possessions degrades, gaining the broken condition. A broken item affected this way is destroyed. The affected item is chosen by the GM, but the curse tends to affect items that are particularly precious to the victim. All mundane clothing is considered to be a single item for this bane, as are all carried coins. This bane has a duration of 1 week.  \n\n#### Nereid\n\nSailors and other seafarers prize the favor of a nereid, though nereids are unpredictable creatures and what earns a specific nereid’s boon may vary wildly. A lustful nereid might grant her boon to attractive humanoids, encouraging them to keep her company in her watery home. Such lovers must be careful not to anger their fey host, or risk being stripped of this gift at an inopportune time. Performing a great service for the nereid, such as reclaiming her stolen shawl, is likely to earn her favor. While some thieves have stolen a nereid’s shawl in hopes of demanding her boon, the cunning fey usually inflicts her bane upon the thief as soon as her shawl is safely back in her possession.  \n  \nA nereid often uses her bane to complement her beguiling aura, especially against lone foes. The nereid may also curse creatures on a whim, delighting in stupefied fools obeying everything they hear. In cases where an nereid’s shawl has fallen into enemy hands, she may attempt to surreptitiously curse whoever has it, hoping to force him to return the precious item.  \n  \n**Boon**: You grow gills, allowing you to breathe water as well as air. This boon is permanent.  \n  \n**Bane**: Whenever someone speaks to you, you must succeed at a Will save (with a DC equal to the DC of the [_fey blight_](/spells/fey-blight) spell-like ability) or treat their words as a [_suggestion_](/spells/suggestion) (as per the spell). This effect only applies if the words could logically be obeyed, at the GM’s discretion. This bane is permanent.  \n\n#### Norn\n\nNorns are among the most powerful fey creatures, with potent knowledge of the future and supernatural control over the fate of mortals. As norns are able to peer into futures yet unwoven, the actions to earn their gifts can seem incomprehensible to all but the norns themselves. On rare occasions, a norn appears before heroes or adventurers—even those that may be lacking in experience or power—and imparts her boon; often, the recipients then become enmeshed in worldshaking events, driven by the supernatural foresight of the fey gift.  \n  \nA norn’s bane is similarly employed in service of her enigmatic goals. A norn might linger on the edge of a great and portentous battle, imparting her bane to those whose death is decreed by fate, or cursing a leader to ensure that an assassin’s blade finds its mark.  \n  \n**Boon**: You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC and on saving throws. In addition, you occasionally (at the GM’s discretion) gain cryptic flashes of insight into the future, or even visions of events to come. This boon has a duration of 9 months.  \n  \n**Bane**: The norn exposes the thread of your fate for others to cut. Melee and ranged attacks against you have their critical threat ranges and multipliers increased to 16–20/×3. In addition, you take a –5 penalty on saving throws against spells. This bane is permanent and much more tenacious than most curses; it can be removed by only a [_miracle_](/spells/miracle) or [_wish_](/spells/wish) spell, or by the norn herself.  \n\n#### Nymph\n\nWhile not bound to locations as literally as dryads, nymphs protect their pure and unspoiled homes to the end. Heroes who defend the nymph’s abode—or any other site of natural beauty—might earn the nymph’s boon. Additionally, nymphs are more willing to interact with mortals than most other fey, and those who perform a great service for a region’s reclusive fey might receive a nymph’s boon. This boon always enhances the recipient’s physical attractiveness in such a way that reflects the nymph’s own appearance, such as changes to match the nymph’s skin or hair color, enlarged or almondshaped eyes, or pointed ears. This manifestation might be due to the nymph’s infusion of her own essence into the recipient, or might simply reflect the fey maiden’s intense narcissism.  \n  \nNymphs are easily angered, and consider their bane to be yet another tool for punishing interlopers. A nymph most often inflicts her bane upon those who rudely disrespect her beauty. Nymphs can inadvertently curse their lovers in the throes of passion without realizing that they have done so, leading to rumors that sharing a nymph’s bed brings madness.  \n  \n**Boon**: Your appearance changes to become more physically attractive for your race and gender; this change always causes you to partly resemble the nymph who granted it. In addition, you are beloved by nature itself; animals and plants have a starting attitude of friendly toward you, and such creatures never attack you unless provoked, compelled, or directed by a bonded master (such as a druid directing her animal companion). This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (8 days for a typical nymph), although the enhancements to the recipient’s appearance are usually permanent.  \n  \n**Bane**: You are haunted by the nymph’s loveliness, before which all other beauty is dross. You no longer benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances. In addition, memories of the nymph’s beauty slowly drive you mad. Once per month, you must succeed at a Will save (with a DC equal to the DC of the [_fey blight_](/spells/fey-blight) spell-like ability) or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. This bane is permanent.\n\n#### Oceanid\n\nVain and unpredictable, oceanids grant their boon most often to those seafarers who honor them as the beautiful queens of the sea that they believe themselves to be. Heroes who dispatch mighty threats to the oceanid’s realm, such as aboleths or scrag tribes, might also earn the fey’s gift. What is granted can be revoked, however, and the wise recipient remains respectful to the ocean queen lest the fickle oceanid remove her favor.  \n  \nDespite their quick tempers, oceanids save their bane only for those who particularly displease them. Directly insulting the oceanid, polluting her home, or refusing to acknowledge her dominion over her realm might provoke an oceanid to inflict her curse. Oceanids travel far and communicate often with sea creatures; a vengeful oceanid might easily track down despoilers and butchers that believe themselves too distant for retribution. Oceanids prefer to curse bards, sea captains, spellcasters, and others who rely on their voices.  \n  \n**Boon**: You can summon a shroud of the oceanid’s water to protect and serve you. You gain the kineticist’s basic hydrokinesis wild talent and shroud of water defense wild talent, as a kineticist with a level equal to your Hit Dice. You cannot accept burn when using these talents unless you have the burn class feature. If you are a hydrokineticist, you instead gain a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls with water-based kinetic blasts. This boon has a duration of 1 day per caster level (9 days for a typical oceanid).  \n  \n**Bane**: Your body becomes extremely withered and dehydrated, and no amount of water can restore you. You are exhausted and cannot recover from the exhausted condition while this curse is in effect. In addition, your dry tongue and cracked lips impose a 20% spell failure chance on any spell with verbal components that you attempt to cast. This bane is permanent.  \n\n#### Quickling\n\nAmong the cruelest fey, quicklings rarely grant their boon. The primary exceptions are when coerced by a greater force, such as a more powerful fey or one of Irrisen’s winter witches, or when they find someone as bitter and wicked as themselves. A quickling might grant its boon under direct duress, but is more likely to attempt to curse its captor instead. When a quickling grants a boon, the treacherous creature revokes it at the earliest opportunity.  \n  \nGiven the long-term nature of the quickling’s bane, the sadistic fey save it for those targets they do not immediately kill, allowing them to savor the torment they inflict. They are quite fond of cursing children, stealing their youth and thrusting them into adulthood. A quickling with no chance of escape might spitefully curse a foe, relying on the bane to punish its killer even after its death. Under almost no circumstances will a quickling revoke its bane, even under threat of death— the hateful creatures would rather die than undo the suffering they’ve caused.  \n  \n**Boon**: The quickling’s boon lets you muster bursts of incredible speed. Once per minute as a swift action, you can gain the benefits of [_haste_](/spells/haste) for 1 round. This boon has a duration of 1 hour per caster level (6 hours for a typical quickling).  \n  \n**Bane**: The quickling’s bane accelerates your body’s aging, causing you to physically age 1 year for every week that passes. Although your physical ability scores are reduced as normal for your body’s age, your mental ability scores do not improve. This bane is permanent; even if removed, any aging that occurred while this bane was in effect can be undone by only [_greater restoration_](/spells/restoration--greater), [_miracle_](/spells/miracle), or [_wish_](/spells/wish).\n\n#### Satyr\n\nThe easiest way to court a satyr’s favor is to join in his revels, whether wild hedonism or open-minded enjoyment of new experiences. A satyr most often grants his boon to those who entertain the satyr in novel and exciting ways, whether by talented artistic performances, bold tales, or—of course—lusty demonstrations. Satyrs love freedom for themselves and others and might grant their boon to champions of liberty.  \n  \nAlthough satyrs are famously ardent in their attempts to persuade others to join their revelry, the vast majority of satyrs will respect refusal—although they are hardly shy about their disappointment. However, merely rejecting a satyr’s advances is usually insufficient to earn his bane; a satyr instead inflicts his bane on those who are particularly cruel or prideful in how they reject his advances or company. In addition, threatening a female fey provokes the wrath of any satyr who learns of such deeds.  \n  \n**Boon**: You take on physical characteristics that the satyr believes will make you more attractive (whether or not his aesthetic preferences match your own). If you are male, you become tall and ruggedly handsome, with a sculpted physique; if you are female, you become beautiful and curvaceous, with long, luxurious hair; if you are agender or nonbinary, you become slender and androgynously beautiful. In addition, you gain powerful sexual magnetism, granting you a +4 enhancement bonus on all Charisma-based skill and ability checks against creatures that could be sexually attracted to you. This boon lasts for 1 day per caster level (8 days for a typical satyr).  \n  \n**Bane**: Your mindset becomes coarse and brutish, and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are reduced by 2 each (to a minimum of 3). In addition, whenever presented with the opportunity to indulge in hedonistic pleasures such as revelry, food and drink, or sexual pleasure, you must succeed at a Will save (with a DC equal to the DC of the [_fey blight_](/spells/fey-blight) spell-like ability) or be compelled to ecstatically indulge yourself to the fullest.

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.  \n  \nSecond, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the _gate_.  \n  \nThe _gate_ itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.  \n  \nA _gate_ has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the _gate_ from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.  \n  \n_Planar Travel_: As a mode of planar travel, a _gate_ spell functions much like a [_plane shift_](/spells/plane-shift) spell, except that the _gate_ opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.  \n  \nYou may hold the _gate_ open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.  \n  \n_Calling Creatures_: The second effect of the _gate_ spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the _gate_ to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the _gate_, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a _gate_ that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.  \n  \nIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.  \n  \nIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the [_lesser planar ally_](/spells/planar-ally--lesser) spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.  \n  \nFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.  \n  \n_Note_: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type."},{name:"Geas, Lesser",source:"[_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 288_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)",school:"enchantment",subschool:"compulsion",descripters:["curse","language-dependent","mind-affecting"],levels:["arcanist 4","bard 3","inquisitor 4","mesmerist 3","psychic 4","skald 3","sorcerer 4","witch 4","wizard 4"],castingTime:"1 round",components:["V"],range:"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)",target:"one living creature with 7 HD or less",duration:"1 day/level or until discharged (D)",savingThrow:"Will negates",spellResistance:"yes",description:"A _lesser geas_ places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you.

The bearer’s blood also takes on a hue like liquid gold and runs slowly, granting him immunity to poison, disease, and aging effects, and causing him to automatically stabilize if reduced to fewer than 0 hit points.

Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores.

Successfully performing the ritual causes the grim stalker to manifest as a Nessian warhound (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 173_) in an available square 20 feet away from the victim, save that its only subtype is extraplanar, its alignment is neutral, its bite and breath weapon deal negative energy damage instead of fire damage, and it has negative energy affinity instead of fire immunity and vulnerability to cold. The grim stalker immediately attacks the affected creature, persisting until either it or the creature is slain, at which point the spell effect (and the warhound) disappears.  \n  \n\n### Haunt Statistics\n\n**Notice** Perception DC 30 (to see a black dog darting toward the target out of the corner of the eye)  \n**hp** 4 hp/level; **Trigger** touch (object); **Reset** none"},{name:"Groundswell",source:"[_Advanced Race Guide pg. 19_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide)",school:"transmutation",descripters:["earth"],levels:["cleric 2","druid 2","hunter 2","magus 2","oracle 2","ranger 2","warpriest 2"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S"],range:"touch",target:"creature touched",duration:"1 minute/level",description:"This spell allows the target to cause the ground to rise up beneath him.

If you cast _harrowing_ on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, “hunting down the pirate king,” or “traveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword”) that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell’s duration.  \n  \nIf you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards, as detailed on page 293 of this book. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card’s alignment matches the target creature’s alignment. If the card and target’s alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit’s check. If the card and target’s alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a –1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit’s check.  \n  \nWhile penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can “spend” at any time to modify that card’s associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a _harrowing_ are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell’s duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed.  \n  \nA single creature can only be under the effects of one _harrowing_ at a time.

You can use each bonus twice—once at this doubled value, the second time at the normal value (+2 or +1). You must use a given card’s doubled bonus before you can use its lower bonus.

When you cast this spell, it remains in effect until it is discharged. Once you cast _infuse effigy_, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it or cast another spell with its spell slot until you dismiss the _infuse effigy_ spell or until it is discharged against a foe. If the number of 4th-level spells that you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of _infuse effigy_ spells, the more recently cast _infuse effigy_ spells in excess of the number of 4th-level spells you can now cast are dispelled.  \n  \nThe nature of the curse that becomes infused into the effigy you touch depends more on the nature of the effigy than anything else. You can cast this spell on a standard effigy (such as a head stuck onto a spike, or on a body hanging from a tree), but can generate more powerful effects by casting the spell on one of the more elaborate effigies detailed above—in this case, it is the established traditions of the effigy as much as the effigy itself that empowers the curse. The larger effigies, such as the tree of souls and the wicker man, have minimum caster level requirements; you must be this level or higher in order to cast _infuse effigy_ on such a target.  \n  \nOnce an effigy is infused, it radiates an aura of unease to a radius of 5 feet per caster level—the first time a creature enters this area, it must make a Will save or become shaken for 1 minute per caster level. This effect can only occur once per creature and is a mind-affecting fear effect. As long as an effigy remains under the effects of this spell, the body parts associated with the effigy become preserved as if by [_gentle repose_](/spells/gentle-repose). Once an effigy has been the focus for an _infuse effigy_ spell, it can never again be the target of this spell—a new effigy must be constructed from new victims if you wish to recreate it. An infused effigy is treated as a magic item for the purposes of saving throws.  \n  \nAn infused effigy has an additional effect on creatures of the same type as the largest creature incorporated into the effigy. If the largest creature is a humanoid or outsider, the additional effect only affects creatures of the largest creature’s subtype. Creatures of this type (and subtype) take a –2 penalty on the saving throw against the effigy’s aura, and as soon as such creatures attack or damage the effigy (from any distance) or approach within 10 feet of it, they must make a Will saving throw or become cursed. If a creature becomes cursed by an infused effigy, the spell effect on the effigy ends (and the caster can now use that spell slot to prepare or cast spells again), but the curse itself is permanent until it is removed. If the creature that triggers the effigy was close friends with or related to anyone whose body was used to construct the effigy, that creature takes a –4 penalty on the Will save to avoid becoming cursed. The specific effects of each type of effigy’s curse are listed below. At the GM’s discretion, other specific effigies might exist, along with specific effects they exhibit when they are the subject of an _infuse effigy_ spell.  \n  \n**Standard Effigy Curse (no minimum CL)**: –2 penalty to an ability score chosen by the caster.  \n  \n**Blood Eagle Curse (no minimum CL)**: –4 penalty to Constitution and –4 penalty on all saving throws against fear effects.  \n  \n**Nithing Pole Curse (no minimum CL)**: Any effect that can be generated by a [_bestow curse_](/spells/bestow-curse) spell.  \n  \n**Tree of Souls Curse (minimum CL 11th)**: The victim heals damage from rest at half normal rate, and any magical healing applied to the victim must succeed at a DC 20 Caster Level check or be negated. The cursed victim takes a –4 penalty on all Constitution-based checks, including stabilization checks and Fortitude saving throws.  \n  \n**Wicker Man Curse (minimum CL 15th)**: –6 penalty to two ability scores chosen by the caster.

As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled—you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of _invoke deity_ decreases by 10 minutes, and you can’t use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell’s duration.  \n  \n**Madness**: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom.  \n  \n**Rune**: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of _glyphs of warding_, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use [_read magic_](/spells/read-magic) at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll’s caster level.  \n  \n**Scalykind**: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.  \n  \n**Strength**: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength.  \n  \n**Sun**: Your form blazes with solar light. You are immune to blindness, the dazzled condition, and all effects generated by powerful light (such as [_searing light_](/spells/searing-light), _sunray_, or the blinding light of a shining child), and you radiate light as the [_daylight_](/spells/daylight) spell.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution.  \n  \n**Trickery**: Your appearance changes as you desire (as [_veil_](/spells/veil), except affecting only yourself). Changing your appearance is a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks.  \n  \n**Void**: Your clothes and hair seem to float about you, as if you were adrift in a weightless environment. You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe. You can exist comfortably in the depths of outer space.  \n  \n**War**: You are surrounded by the sounds of battle. You gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls with your deity’s favored weapon and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with your deity’s favored weapon each time you hit a foe. You can use your deity’s favored weapon as a divine focus or holy symbol.  \n  \n**Water**: You gain gills, webbed fingers, and other ichthyic features. You gain a swim speed of 40 feet, can breathe water, and ignore the usual penalties on weapon attack and damage rolls from fighting underwater.  \n  \n**Weather**: Your hair and clothing are constantly wind-tossed, and you crackle with electricity. You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather.

This works just like the overrun combat maneuver, but you do not need to attempt a check; you merely have to move over your opponents. Targets take damage equal to 2d6 plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier from your trample, and can make attacks of opportunity against you, but at a –4 penalty. If a targets forgoes an attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the trample and take half damage. The save DC against this effect is equal to 10 + half your caster level + your Strength modifier. You can deal only trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.  \n  \n**Trip**: Choose one of the natural attacks granted to you by your new form.

This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell’s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.  \n  \nThe casting of _judgment undone_ is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell’s 10-minute casting time, an olethros appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless _judgment undone_ has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment—how successful she may be depends on the GM’s discretion.  \n  \nThe caster of _judgment undone_ can pause the spell’s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on _judgment undone_ and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.  \n  \nIt is possible to cast _judgment undone_ without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM’s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast _judgment undone_ is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it’s not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell’s casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell’s material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma’s code of conduct."},{name:"Judgment Light",source:"[_Ultimate Combat pg. 232_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz)",school:"evocation",descripters:["light"],levels:["inquisitor 4"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S"],range:"personal",area:"30-ft.-radius burst",duration:"instantaneous, see text",savingThrow:"see text",spellResistance:"yes",description:"An inquisitor may only cast this spell while she has a judgment active.

You can’t choose recipients that rely on unobservable information, such as creatures of a certain alignment or of a particular class.  \n  \nYou can’t pick and choose individual creatures to target or exclude. While the spell’s range defaults to 1 mile per caster level, you can choose to reduce it to a smaller radius, although the spell’s area can’t be shaped.  \n  \nThe nature of the spell prevents the message it carries from having any magical power; the message can’t be used to transmit spells or abilities that are conveyed via speech. The message is transmitted in your voice in whatever language you use to speak it, and is not automatically translated. Any steps you take to disguise your voice are just as effective for messages delivered via this spell as they are for your normal speech. Mage’s decree isn’t a language-dependent spell; all targeted creatures receive the message, but might not understand it if they don’t understand the language in which you spoke the message."},{name:"Mage's Disjunction",source:"[_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 306_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)",school:"abjuration",levels:["arcanist 9","psychic 9","sorcerer 9","wizard 9"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V"],range:"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)",area:"all magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft. radius burst, or one magic item (see text)",duration:"1 minute/level",savingThrow:"Will negates (object)",spellResistance:"no",description:"All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of [_protection from evil_](/spells/protection-from-evil)), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.  \n  \nThis spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A _magic circle against evil_ can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the [_lesser planar binding_](/spells/planar-binding--lesser), [_planar binding_](/spells/planar-binding), and [_greater planar binding_](/spells/planar-binding--greater) spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the _magic circle_. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal [_protection from evil_](/spells/protection-from-evil) spell for that creature only.  \n  \nA _magic circle_ leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel ([_astral projection_](/spells/astral-projection), [_blink_](/spells/blink), [_dimension door_](/spells/dimension-door), [_etherealness_](/spells/etherealness), [_gate_](/spells/gate), [_plane shift_](/spells/plane-shift), [_shadow walk_](/spells/shadow-walk), [_teleport_](/spells/teleport), and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a [_dimensional anchor_](/spells/dimensional-anchor) spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the _anchor_ effect lasts as long as the _magic circle_ does. The creature cannot reach across the _magic circle_, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.  \n  \nYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the _magic circle_ more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.  \n  \nA successful diagram allows you to cast a [_dimensional anchor_](/spells/dimensional-anchor) spell on the _magic circle_ during the round before casting any summoning spell. The _anchor_ holds any called creatures in the _magic circle_ for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a _magic circle_ prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the [_lesser planar binding_](/spells/planar-binding--lesser) spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.  \n  \nThis spell is not cumulative with [_protection from evil_](/spells/protection-from-evil) and vice versa."},{name:"Magic Circle against Good",source:"[_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 308_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)",school:"abjuration",descripters:["evil"],levels:["antipaladin 3","arcanist 3","cleric 3","inquisitor 3","medium 3","occultist 3","oracle 3","shaman 3","sorcerer 3","spiritualist 3","summoner 3","summoner (unchained) 3","warpriest 3","wizard 3"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S","M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)"],range:"touch",area:"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature",duration:"10 min./level",savingThrow:"Will negates (harmless)",spellResistance:"no see text",description:"This spell functions like [_magic circle against evil_](/spells/magic-circle-against-evil), except that it is similar to [_protection from good_](/spells/protection-from-good) instead of [_protection from evil_](/spells/protection-from-evil), and it can imprison a nonevil called creature."},{name:"Magic Circle against Law",source:"[_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 308_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)",school:"abjuration",descripters:["chaotic"],levels:["antipaladin 3","arcanist 3","cleric 3","inquisitor 3","medium 3","occultist 3","oracle 3","shaman 3","sorcerer 3","spiritualist 3","summoner 3","summoner (unchained) 3","warpriest 3","wizard 3"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S","M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)"],range:"touch",area:"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature",duration:"10 min./level",savingThrow:"Will negates (harmless)",spellResistance:"no see text",description:"This spell functions like [_magic circle against evil_](/spells/magic-circle-against-evil), except that it is similar to [_protection from law_](/spells/protection-from-law) instead of [_protection from evil_](/spells/protection-from-evil), and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature."},{name:"Magic Circle Against Technology",source:"[_Technology Guide pg. 9_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy95d2?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide)",school:"abjuration",levels:["arcanist 4","cleric 4","oracle 4","sorcerer 4","warpriest 4","wizard 4"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S","M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered copper)"],range:"touch",area:"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature",duration:"10 minute/level",savingThrow:"Will negates (harmless), see text",spellResistance:"no",description:"All creatures within the area gain the effects of a [_protection from technology_](/spells/protection-from-technology) spell.

Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the _magic jar_, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.  \n  \nIf you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the _magic jar_. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.

A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.  \n  \nAs a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the _magic jar_ if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.  \n  \nIf the host body is slain, you return to the _magic jar_, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.  \n  \nIf the spell ends while you are in the _magic jar_, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the _magic jar_ returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the _magic jar_ or the host's location."},{name:"Magic Missile",source:"[_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 309_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)",school:"evocation",descripters:["force"],levels:["arcanist 1","bloodrager 1","magus 1","psychic 1","sorcerer 1","wizard 1"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S"],range:"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)",targets:"up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart",duration:"instantaneous",savingThrow:"none",spellResistance:"yes",description:"A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.  \n  \nThe missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment.

You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can’t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a _mindscape door_ within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.  \n  \nWhen you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you from creating the door if she is within the mindscape.

Additionally, if a creature in possession of the object casts a spell that appears on your spell list, there is a 10% chance that the _mnemonic siphon_ absorbs that spell, causing it to fail as though it had been successfully countered. Whenever the _mnemonic siphon_ absorbs a spell in this fashion, it causes the knowledge of the absorbed spell to appear directly in your mind. You can use this knowledge to prepare the spell if you have an unused spell slot capable of casting it. You can also use the knowledge to write the spell into a spellbook or teach it to your familiar. This knowledge remains in your mind for 24 hours, after which time it is lost. The _mnemonic siphon_ is capable of absorbing up to 1 spell per 2 caster levels you have before being discharged. If you are not capable of learning a stolen spell normally, the knowledge is useless to you."},{name:"Modify Memory",source:"[_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 315_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)",school:"enchantment",subschool:"compulsion",descripters:["mind-affecting"],levels:["bard 4","medium 4","mesmerist 4","psychic 5","skald 4"],castingTime:"1 round see text",components:["V","S"],range:"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)",target:"one living creature",duration:"permanent",savingThrow:"Will negates",spellResistance:"yes",description:"You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.\n\n*   Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced.

If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.  \n  \nThese mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.  \n  \n_8th Level_: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.  \n  \n_10th Level_: The mount can use [_water walk_](/spells/water-walk) at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).  \n  \n_12th Level_: The mount can use [_air walk_](/spells/air-walk) at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.  \n  \n_14th Level_: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.\n\n#### Mythic Phantom Steed\n\n**Source** [_Mythic Adventures pg. 103_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures)  \nThe steed’s rider automatically succeeds at Ride checks to remain mounted.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.  \n  \nTo create the trap, you must use a _magic circle_ spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.  \n  \nThe target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A [_dimensional anchor_](/spells/dimensional-anchor) cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see [_magic circle against evil_](/spells/magic-circle-against-evil)) to make the trap more secure.  \n  \nIf the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you.  \n  \nOnce the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.  \n  \nWhen you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type."},{name:"Planar Inquiry",source:"[_Adventurer's Guide pg. 125_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide), [_Arcane Anthology pg. 14_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9i8l?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Arcane-Anthology\n)",school:"conjuration",subschool:"calling",levels:["arcanist 3","cleric 3","druid 3","hunter 3","inquisitor 3","oracle 3","shaman 3","sorcerer 3","summoner 3","summoner (unchained) 3","warpriest 3","witch 3","wizard 3"],castingTime:"10 minutes",components:["V","S","M (offerings worth 100 gp per HD of the creature called)"],range:"close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)",effect:"one called outsiders who ansswers questions",duration:"instantaneous see text",savingThrow:"none",spellResistance:"no",description:"Although he was hardly the first to turn to the Outer Planes for answers, Jatembe’s dealings with outsiders in his pursuit of enlightenment are legendary, and the Magaambya credits the Old-Mage with the creation of this spell.  \n  \nThis spell calls a creature from another plane to your precise location, functioning like [_lesser planar ally_](/spells/planar-ally--lesser) except as noted.

The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like [_invisibility_](/spells/invisibility) (self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for [_greater teleport_](/spells/teleport--greater) (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing [_summon monster II_](/spells/summon-monster-ii) (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can’t store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp.  \n  \nThe save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as controlling the target of [_dominate person_](/spells/dominate-person). The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round’s worth of actions.  \n  \nIf the sacrificed creature doesn’t die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell’s duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power. The fragment of the creature’s spirit trapped in the bloodstone does not hinder attempts to restore the creature to life."},{name:"Pocketful of Vipers",source:"[_Ultimate Intrigue pg. 222_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue\n)",school:"conjuration",subschool:"summoning",levels:["druid 3","hunter 3","occultist 3","shaman 3","witch 3"],castingTime:"1 round",components:["V","S","M (a snake scale and fang)"],range:"touch",target:"object touched",duration:"1 hour/level or until discharged (D)",savingThrow:"Fortitude negates (object)",spellResistance:"no",description:"You set a magical ward upon the object touched, which must be a container such as a pouch, bag, backpack, or pocket.

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.  \n  \nSince the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.  \n  \nA reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.  \n  \nIt's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.  \n  \nFor a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.  \n  \nA creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated.

This has three effects.  \n  \nFirst, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark).  \n  \nSecond, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, [_cure light wounds_](/spells/cure-light-wounds) cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast [_prayer_](/spells/prayer), that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target’s friendship with the cleric.  \n  \nThird, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.  \n  \nThis powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.  \n  \nThis mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use [_atonement_](/spells/atonement) to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; [_remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse) also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the _reprobation_."},{name:"Repulsion",source:"[_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 333_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)",school:"abjuration",levels:["arcanist 6","cleric 7","inquisitor 6","occultist 6","oracle 7","psychic 7","sorcerer 6","spiritualist 6","summoner 5","summoner (unchained) 6","wizard 6"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S","F/DF (a pair of canine statuettes worth 50 gp)"],range:"up to 10 ft./level",area:"up to 10-ft.-radius/level emanation centered on you",duration:"1 round/level (D)",savingThrow:"Will negates",spellResistance:"yes",description:"An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from approaching you.

Destroying one part of it does not cause the remainder of the structure to collapse, though each 5-foot section destroyed reduces the maximum weight the creation can support by 200 pounds. During any round in which the rope is overloaded, every remaining section takes 1d4 points of damage.  \n  \nYou can use _ropeweave_ to create any of the following structures.  \n  \n**Rope Bridge**: The rope forms a 5-foot-wide bridge that spans up to 10 feet horizontally per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Creatures can cross the bridge at half speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check or at full speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. The DC assumes a creature is using both hands to assist in navigating the rope bridge; the DC increases by 5 if a creature uses only one hand to steady itself and by 10 if the creature does not use its hands. A failed Acrobatics check results in failure to progress across the rope bridge; creatures that fail by 5 or more fall.  \n  \n**Rope Hammock**: The rope knits itself into a stationary hammock suspended in midair. The hammock can be suspended at a height of 5 feet plus 5 feet per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 30 feet), with a rope ladder (see below) leading up to a platform of 1 5-foot square per caster level, and at least one such square must be adjacent to the square containing the vertical rope ladder. As a move action, the caster can command the rope ladder to withdraw into the hammock. When the ladder is withdrawn, the rope hammock blends in with its surroundings and muffles sounds and smells from creatures resting on it that are taking no violent actions; noticing the rope hammock requires a successful DC 20 Perception check or Survival check, even for creatures with scent. This does not apply if the creatures in the hammock attack or move more than half speed. The hammock provides a +2 cover bonus to AC against attacks from beneath it.  \n  \n**Rope Ladder**: The rope knots itself and hangs suspended in midair, perpendicular to the ground, stretching up to 10 feet vertically per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Climbing the rope ladder requires a successful DC 5 Climb check, or DC 0 if there is a wall adjacent to it you can brace it against.  \n  \n**Trip Line**: The rope stretches into a tangled mass that fills one 5-foot square per caster level you have (maximum 10 squares), all of which must be contiguous (including diagonally). Any creature entering a square with this trip line must succeed at an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 if moving at half speed, DC = 15 if moving at full speed, and DC = 20 if running or charging). On a failed check, the creature’s movement stops when it enters the square; a creature that fails by 5 or more falls prone.

Alternatively, a creature can activate the rune of love after he rolls damage for a weapon or spell attack, causing the damage dealt to become nonlethal damage.  \n  \n**Temperance**: A creature bearing the rune of temperance can activate it as an immediate action immediately upon failing a saving throw against a poison, disease, drug, or similar effect.

This lasts 1 day.  \n  \nMultiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in conjuring and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect for a particular conjuration. A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target—few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.  \n  \nThe table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering’s equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of [_planar ally_](/spells/planar-ally). Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of [_miracle_](/spells/miracle) or [_wish_](/spells/wish). The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature’s choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.  \n  \nYou cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values.

The suggested activity must not cause the target to directly harm itself or others, but it doesn’t need to be reasonable. For example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or poison its ally’s rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de grace action against a sleeping ally.

The contract may be as simple as allowing the target one casting of each of the imbued spells (as per [_imbue with spell ability_](/spells/imbue-with-spell-ability)), or may continue for multiple days or even indefinitely, with the target regaining use of the imbued spells when you next prepare your own spells. You may include any proviso you see fit, such as requiring the target to pray to Asmodeus each morning, or restricting the target to only casting the imbued spells on himself. If the target does not agree to all the conditions in the contract, this spell fails when cast. The contract (and this spell) automatically expires if you or the target dies. While the contract remains in effect, you gain a profane bonus to your Armor Class, saving throws, and checks equal to the highestlevel spell you have imbued.  \n  \nOnce you cast this spell, you cannot prepare a new 5th-level spell to replace it until the contract expires. If the number of 5th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active _lesser spellcasting_ contract spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.  \n  \nUnlike [_imbue with spell ability_](/spells/imbue-with-spell-ability), how the target uses the spell has no reflection on your alignment or relationship with Asmodeus; the Prince of Darkness accepts that allowing another access to his magic for good may benefit his plans in the long run. Note that unlike [_imbue with spell ability_](/spells/imbue-with-spell-ability), you cannot dismiss this spell; you must abide by the contract’s termination clause (though the contract may include a proviso for at-will nullification by either or both parties). This spell cannot be combined with [_imbue with spell ability_](/spells/imbue-with-spell-ability) or similar spells to give a target more spells than the limit.  \n  \n_Example_: You cast this spell on your 5 HD fighter cohort after negotiating an appropriate contract, imbuing him with the ability to cast [_cure moderate wounds_](/spells/cure-moderate-wounds), [_magic weapon_](/spells/magic-weapon), and [_shield of faith_](/spells/shield-of-faith) once per day for 1 month. If he casts any of these spells, he recovers them when you prepare your spells. Until the contract ends, your 5th-level spell slot used to cast this spell remains expended and cannot be filled with a new spell.

It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10–1. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.  \n  \nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as [_wish_](/spells/wish)).  \n  \nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10–1 marked with an “\\*” are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an “\\*” always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\'s type match your alignment.  \n  \n**Nethys Note: according to the [_Monster Summoner\'s Handbook_ pg. 18](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ela?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Monster-Summoners-Handbook), _summon monster_ can be used to summon creatures with the entropic or resolute tempaltes instead of the

When triggered, a _symbol of death_ kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The _symbol of death_ affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the _symbol_ becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the _symbol of death_ is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the _symbol_ only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the _symbol_ is still active, it must save again.  \n  \nUntil it is triggered, the _symbol of death_ is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a _symbol of death_ must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the _symbol of death_ ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the _symbol of death_ works normally.  \n  \nAs a default, a _symbol of death_ is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a _symbol of death_'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.  \n  \nIn this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a _symbol of death_ to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a _symbol of death_ offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered _symbol of death_ remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a _symbol of death_ cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.  \n  \nYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.  \n  \nWhen scribing a _symbol of death_, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.  \n  \nYou also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a _symbol of death_ cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own _symbols of death_, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.  \n  \n[_Read magic_](/spells/read-magic) allows you to identify a _symbol_ with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol's spell level). Of course, if the _symbol_ is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.  \n  \nA _symbol of death_ can be removed by a successful [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) targeted solely on the rune. An [_erase_](/spells/erase) spell has no effect on a _symbol of death_. Destruction of the surface where a _symbol of death_ is inscribed destroys the _symbol_ but also triggers it.  \n  \n_Symbol of death_ can be made permanent with a [_permanency_](/spells/permanency) spell. A permanent _symbol of death_ that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.  \n  \n_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of death_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol of death_ and Disable Device to thwart it.

A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.  \n  \nTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.  \n  \n_Familiarity_: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying.  \n  \n“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.  \n  \n_On Target_: You appear where you want to be.  \n  \n_Off Target_: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.  \n  \n_Similar Area_: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.  \n  \n_Mishap_: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.

For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area’s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn’t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn’t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  \n  \nYou can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  \n  \nMultiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  \n  \nThis spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.  \n  \nIf you’re at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level."},{name:"Terrain Bond",source:"[_Ultimate Combat pg. 247_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz)",school:"enchantment",subschool:"compulsion",descripters:["mind-affecting"],levels:["hunter 4","ranger 4"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","S","M (a pinch of earth taken from your most favored terrain)"],range:"personal",target:"you",duration:"1 hour/2 levels (D)",description:"You call upon the spirits of nature to help you adapt to your environment.

Two to five _wish_ spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two _wishes_ for a +2 inherent bonus, three _wishes_ for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. _Note_: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.\n*   Remove injuries and afflictions. A single _wish_ can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same _wish_.\n*   Revive the dead. A _wish_ can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a [_resurrection_](/spells/resurrection) spell.

The _wish_ forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a _wish_ could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.\n\n  \nYou may try to use a _wish_ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The _wish_ may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM's discretion.)  \n  \nDuplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).  \n  \nWhen a _wish_ duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell).\n\n#### Mythic Wish\n\n**Source** [_Mythic Adventures pg. 112_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures)  \nWhen using _mythic wish_ to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you’re a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you’re a caster who prepares spells).

Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave.

You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave’s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that. The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).  \n  \nYou can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate."},{name:"Wracking Ray",source:"[_Champions of Corruption pg. 25_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy991x?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Champions-of-Corruption\n)",school:"necromancy",descripters:["evil","pain"],levels:["arcanist 5","sorcerer 5","witch 5","wizard 5"],castingTime:"1 standard action",components:["V","M (an old bone","broken in the casting)"],range:"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)",effect:"ray",duration:"instantaneous",savingThrow:"Fortitude half",spellResistance:"yes",description:"A ray of sickly greenish-gray negative energy issues forth from the palm of your hand.

Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver.  \n  \nFurthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the [_warding weapon_](/spells/warding-weapon) spell. While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat.  \n  \nLastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four _+1 frost mithral daggers_ as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice.

This causes such creatures to seek to aid any obvious minions or worshipers of Hastur in sight, and any true worshiper of Hastur can command the affected creatures as if that worshiper had been the one to dominate them. In the case of conflicting commands issued from different true worshipers of Hastur, the commanders must attempt opposed Charisma checks, with the winner being able to command the targets for that round. If no worshipers or agents of Hastur are in sight, an affected creature can act normally. When affected by this spell’s Yellow Sign in this way, the effects last for 1 round per level. Once triggered, the Yellow Sign remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  \n  \nThere is a 1% chance when a creature fails its saving throw against this spell that Hastur takes note and, for reasons of his own, decides to control the target personally.
