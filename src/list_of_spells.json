If the idea is contrary to the target’s normal thoughts (such as making a paladin think, “I should murder my friends”) the target may suspect mind-altering magic is at play. The idea must be fairly clear, enough so that it can be conveyed in one or two sentences. You do not need to share a common language for the spell to\nsucceed, but without a common language you can only sow the most basic rudimentary ideas."

Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.\nFor every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile — two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of\nfive missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage."
