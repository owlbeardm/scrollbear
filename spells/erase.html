  <meta name="Description" content="_Erase_ removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove [_explosive runes_](/spells/explosive-runes), a [_glyph of warding_](/spells/glyph-of-warding), a [_sepia snake sigil_](/spells/sepia-snake-sigil), or an [_arcane mark_](/spells/arcane-mark), but not [_illusory script_](/spells/illusory-script) or a _symbol_ spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.  
  
Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase [_explosive runes_](/spells/explosive-runes), a [_glyph of warding_](/spells/glyph-of-warding), or a [_sepia snake sigil_](/spells/sepia-snake-sigil), you accidentally activate that writing instead.">
