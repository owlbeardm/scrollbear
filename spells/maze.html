On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as [_teleport_](/spells/teleport) and [_dimension door_](/spells/dimension-door), do not help a creature escape a _maze_ spell, although a [_plane shift_](/spells/plane-shift) spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.
