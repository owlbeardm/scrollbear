  <meta name="Description" content="You imbue a number of creatures with mythic power, granting each of them 1st tier in a mythic path of its choice. The creatures immediately gain the benefits of their chosen paths. Divide the duration evenly among all targets.  
  
The targets retain their mythic tier only while they’re within 100 feet of the spell’s focus component. A target that goes outside this range loses its mythic tier, but instantly regains it if it moves into range again. If the focus component is destroyed while the spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent negative levels.

If you expend one use of mythic power when casting this spell, the duration increases to 1 day per level, and you can use yourself as the focus for this spell instead of a lesser artifact. If you’re the focus, the targets retain their mythic tier only while they’re within 100 feet of you, and if you die, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent negative levels.">
