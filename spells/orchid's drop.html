Although they have yet to unlock the elixir’s exact formula, their efforts have not been entirely wasted. One by-product of their experiments was the _orchid’s drop_ formula. This extract, distilled from a much-diluted drop of the nectar of a sun orchid flower, can transform an alchemist’s mutagen into a potent healing tonic.  
  
As long as you’re under the effects of _orchid’s drop_, drinking a dose of your mutagen heals you of 2d10 points of damage. For the spell’s duration, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving throws.">
