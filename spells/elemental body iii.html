The abilities you gain depend upon the type of elemental into which you change. You are also immune to bleed damage, critical hits, and sneak attacks while in elemental form.

**Source** [_Mythic Adventures pg. 92_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures)  
Each _mythic elemental body_ spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic _elemental body_ spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know a lower-level _mythic elemental body_ spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn _mythic elemental body II_ if you know [_elemental body II_](/spells/elemental-body-ii), even if you don’t know _mythic elemental body I_). Each _mythic elemental body_ spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against you is treated as a normal hit, as if you were wearing _medium fortification_ armor.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. You can also, a number of times equal to your tier, add half your tier to the DC of one spell you cast with an energy descriptor that matches your elemental type (air: electricity, earth: acid, fire: fire, water: cold).">
