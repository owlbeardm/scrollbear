    Moment of Prescience - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell's duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the _moment of prescience_ before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one _moment of prescience_ active on you at the same time.">
