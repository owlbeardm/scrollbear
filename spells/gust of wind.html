    Gust of Wind - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a –4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown back 2d6 × 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the force of the wind.  
  
A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.  
  
Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind.  
  
Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check.  
  
Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect.  
  
This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of it's range.  
  
Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a _gust of wind_.  
  
The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.  
  
In addition to the effects noted, a _gust of wind_ can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.  
  
_Gust of wind_ can be made permanent with a [_permanency_](/spells/permanency) spell.

The force of the wind increases to windstorm (approximately 70 mph; _Core Rulebook_ 439). All effects described in the spell affect creatures one size larger. Ranged attacks can’t be attempted in the area of the spell. The wind automatically blows out unprotected flames and has a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames.  
  
**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell lasts for 1 additional round and the range increases by 30 feet. As a swift action at the start of your turn, you can expend another use of mythic power to extend the duration by 1 round and the range by another 30 feet.">
