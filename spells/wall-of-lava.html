  <title>Wall of Lava - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell creates a vertical _wall of lava_ that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A _wall of lava_‘s maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a _wall of lava_ can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall’s overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a _wall of lava_, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).

A creature can move through a _wall of lava_ as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a _wall of lava_ inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A _wall of lava_ also radiates heat as if it were a _wall of fire_, although the heat from a _wall of lava_ radiates from both sides.

Once per round as a move action, you can direct the _wall of lava_ to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall’s overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a _wall of lava_ from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.

All damage inflicted by physical contact with a _wall of lava_ continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).">

  This spell creates a vertical _wall of lava_ that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A _wall of lava_‘s maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a _wall of lava_ can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall’s overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a _wall of lava_, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).

A creature can move through a _wall of lava_ as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a _wall of lava_ inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A _wall of lava_ also radiates heat as if it were a _wall of fire_, although the heat from a _wall of lava_ radiates from both sides.
