You specify what aversion the illusion depicts when you cast the spell. The vampire reacts to the illusion as if it were real; it can overcome the effect by succeeding at a disbelief save or a normal Will save against the illusion’s DC (instead of the normal DC 25 to overcome its revulsion). The illusion is only quasireal and cannot otherwise affect creatures.">
