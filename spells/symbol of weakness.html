    Symbol of Weakness - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), except that every creature within 60 feet of a _symbol of weakness_ instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.  
  
Unlike [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), _symbol of weakness_ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of weakness_ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.  
  
_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of weakness_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol of weakness_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for _symbol of weakness_.">
