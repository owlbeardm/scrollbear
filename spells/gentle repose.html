Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see [_raise dead_](/spells/raise-dead)). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less unpleasant.  
  
The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.">
