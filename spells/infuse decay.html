Once you cast _infuse decay_, you can’t prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it (see [_imbue with spell ability_](/spells/imbue-with-spell-ability) for further details). The infused spell is automatically triggered the next time the undead creature makes a successful touch attack or attack with a natural weapon. An intelligent undead can choose not to trigger the spell on a hit. Only one infused spell can be triggered per attack. An intelligent undead can choose which spell to trigger if it has more than one infused spell. A nonintelligent undead triggers a random spell when it hits with a natural weapon. Only one spell can be triggered per round, regardless of the number of attacks the undead makes.">
