  This spell functions similarly to [_plane shift_](/spells/plane-shift), but instead of transporting the targets to a destination near an intended location on a specific plane, _anywhere but here_ transports affected creatures to a random plane. A creature can be affected by _anywhere but here_ only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets can, by chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell). Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is determined by the table below; the location on the destination plane where the transported creatures arrive is completely subject to the GM’s whim.
