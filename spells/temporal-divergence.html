  <meta name="Description" content="This spell allows you to witness two divergent decisions and choose which to pursue. Upon completing this spell, you must immediately choose two other different spells that you could cast at that moment and that each have a casting time of 1 standard action; these spells take effect simultaneously, and you must track all resulting effects, areas of effect, saving throws, and other outcomes separately as if each had been cast normally and the other spell had never happened. Once you’ve seen how each spell resolves, you must choose which version of reality occurred, expending the standard action, prepared spell, and material components as necessary. The other spell’s results are ignored and do not require an action or expend the prepared spell, spell slot, or material components. If the targets of the spell you did not choose expended any resources or effects to resist your spell, those resources or effects are also not expended. If you cast this spell and do not or cannot immediately follow the instructions described above, this spell has no effect.

For example, after casting this spell, a wizard could cast [temporal stasis](/spells/temporal-stasis) on a demon and [fireball](/spells/fireball) on a group of orcs. Seeing that the demon succeeds at its saving throw against [temporal stasis](/spells/temporal-stasis) and that the [fireball](/spells/fireball) kills many orcs, the wizard chooses the [fireball](/spells/fireball) to take effect. The [temporal stasis](/spells/temporal-stasis) is treated as if it had not been cast, and its spell slot and costly material component are not expended.

Casting this spell more than once in a single day is risky. On the second and subsequent casting in a 24-hour period, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or be exposed to a crippling array of possibilities and paradoxes that leave you confused for 24 hours. Whenever this [confusion](/spells/confusion) would cause you to attack the nearest creature, you instead expend your highest-level remaining prepared spell or spell slot, if any, with no effect.">
