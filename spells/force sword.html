  <meta name="Description" content="You create a _+1 longsword_ of pure force sized appropriately for you that you can wield or give to another creature like any other longsword. At 8th level, the sword functions as a _+2 longsword_. At 13th level, it functions as a _+3 longsword_. A _force sword_ cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), [_disintegrate_](/spells/disintegrate), a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it.  
  
If a creature you attack with the sword has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the _force sword_ strikes it. If you fail the check, the spell is dispelled. If you succeed, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.">
