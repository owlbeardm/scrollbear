    Spiritual Ally - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god. The spiritual ally occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The _spiritual ally_ carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for [_spiritual weapon_](/spells/spiritual-weapon)), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your _spiritual ally_ can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The _spiritual ally_ threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The _spiritual ally_ uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the _spiritual ally_ hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures.  
  
Each round after the first, you can move the _spiritual ally_ as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the _spiritual ally_ cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), [_disintegrate_](/spells/disintegrate), a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. A _spiritual ally’s_ AC against touch attacks is 10.  
  
If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the _spiritual ally_ strikes it. If the _ally_ is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.">
