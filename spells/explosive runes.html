  <meta name="Description" content="You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The _explosive runes_ detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the _explosive runes_ (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the _explosive runes_ is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the _explosive runes_ were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).  
  
You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the _explosive runes_. Likewise, you can remove the _explosive runes_ whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) or [_erase_](/spells/erase) spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the _explosive runes_ and failing to do so triggers the explosion.  
  
Magic traps such as _explosive runes_ are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart _explosive runes_. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for _explosive runes_.">
