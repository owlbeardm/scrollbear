    Cultural Adaptation (Taldan) - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="During the height of the Empire of Taldor’s expansionism, Taldan wizards developed this spell with the idea that it might make pacifying their “uncivilized” conquests easier. While the spell has since fallen out of favor with Taldans, it is much embraced by others, bards and Pathfinders in particular.  
  
When casting this spell, you must concentrate on the culture to which you wish to adapt. If you speak the native language of the culture in question, then for the duration of this spell, you speak the language with a native accent. The spell does not teach you the language in question, but may be combined with [_tongues_](/spells/tongues) or a similar spell. Your body language and gestures mark you as a native of the culture, and you unconsciously make small decisions that help you blend in. These combined new traits give you a +2 on Diplomacy checks made to influence members of the culture to which you have adapted. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks made to pass yourself off as a member of the culture. Additionally, the DCs of enchantment (charm) spells you cast against natives of the culture to which you are attuned increase by +1.">
