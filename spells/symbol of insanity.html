    Symbol of Insanity - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), except that all creatures within the radius of the _symbol of insanity_ instead become permanently insane (as the [_insanity_](/spells/insanity) spell).  
  
Unlike [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), _symbol of insanity_ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of insanity_ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of insanity_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol of insanity_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for _symbol of insanity_.">
