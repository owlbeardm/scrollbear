  <meta name="Description" content="You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The _illusory script_ appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character.  
  
Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a [_suggestion_](/spells/suggestion) implanted in the script by you at the time the _illusory script_ spell was cast. The [_suggestion_](/spells/suggestion) lasts only 30 minutes. Typical _suggestions_ include “Close the book and leave,” “Forget the existence of this note,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), the _illusory script_ and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the [_true seeing_](/spells/true-seeing) spell with the [_read magic_](/spells/read-magic) or [_comprehend languages_](/spells/comprehend-languages) spell.">
