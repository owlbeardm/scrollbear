  <meta name="Description" content="A ghostly manifestation of one of your ancestors appears before you bearing a weapon of your choice in its hands. The weapon may be any simple, martial, or dwarven weapon. It has a +1 enhancement bonus and one weapon special ability (your choice) from the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ with a price equivalent to a +1 bonus (if the weapon is a double weapon, the ability and the enhancement bonus only apply to one end, or the weapon can have a +1 enhancement bonus on both ends but no other magical abilities).  
  
You may use the weapon as if you were proficient in it. The weapon may not be wielded by anyone else, and if removed from your grasp, it vanishes and the spell ends immediately.  
  
If you conjure a weapon with the _flaming_, _frost_, _shock_, or _thundering_ property, this spell has the fire, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor (respectively).">
