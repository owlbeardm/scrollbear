The target still experiences the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons or potions). _Feast of ashes_ can be removed with a [_break enchantment_](/spells/break-enchantment), [_limited wish_](/spells/limited-wish), [_miracle_](/spells/miracle), [_remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse), or [_wish_](/spells/wish) spell, but effects suffered as a result of starvation must be healed by normal means.

On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist the effects of starvation as part of this spell’s effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires eating, such as the food from a _heroes’ feast_ spell (though the food is still used up when the target eats it).">
