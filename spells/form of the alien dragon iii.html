    Form of the Alien Dragon III - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as per [_form of the alien dragon II_](/spells/form-of-the-alien-dragon-ii), except it also allows you to take the form of a Huge esoteric or outer dragon. Psychics can choose from the esoteric dragon (astral, dream, etheric, nightmare, or occult) forms only. You gain the following: a +10 size bonus to your Strength, a +8 size bonus to your Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 120 feet (poor), blindsense with a range of 60 feet, darkvision with a range of 120 feet, a breath weapon, damage reduction 10/magic, frightful presence (DC = DC for this spell), and immunity to one form of energy or effect (of the same type form of the alien dragon I grants either a bonus against or resistance to, if any). You also gain one bite attack (2d8), two claw attacks (2d6), two wing attacks (1d8), and one tail slap attack (2d6). You can use the breath weapon as often as you like, but must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 12d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones.">
