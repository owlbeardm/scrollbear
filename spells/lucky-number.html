  <meta name="Description" content="The Path of Numbers

The Path of Numbers is a system of numerology that describes eight basic energies. Any of these types of energy can interact at any time, producing 64 possible combinations. It is believed that those 64 combinations are sufficient to describe the basis of every interaction in the cosmos. No matter the plane, creature, or time in question, every event in the multiverse is based on one of those 64 templates. In short, the Path of Numbers is a periodic table of energetic elements.

You are able to tweak tiny variables affecting a creature’s immediate future in order to grant the target a bit of luck at the right time.

Roll a d20; once during the duration of _lucky number_, when the target creature rolls that result (regardless of what type of dice the target rolls), the creature has the option to either reroll the result or add a +2 luck bonus to the result. The creature must decide to use this ability before the success or failure of the original roll is known. A creature can have only one _lucky number_ at a time. If _lucky number_ is cast on a creature already affected by that spell, the new number replaces the previous one.">
