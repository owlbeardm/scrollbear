  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as [_beast shape III_](/spells/beast-shape-iii) except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Tiny or Large creature of the magical beast type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: burrow 60 feet, climb 90 feet, fly 120 feet (good maneuverability), swim 120 feet, blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 90 feet, low-light vision, scent, tremorsense 60 feet, breath weapon, constrict, ferocity, grab, jet, poison, pounce, rake, rend, roar, spikes, trample, trip, and web. If the creature has immunity or resistance to any elements, you gain resistance 20 to those elements. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability.  
  
_Tiny magical beast_: If the form you take is that of a Tiny magical beast, you gain a –2 penalty to your Strength, a +8 size bonus to your Dexterity, and a +3 natural armor bonus.

Each _mythic beast shape_ spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic _beast shape_ spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order and are not required to know a lower-level _mythic beast shape_ spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn _mythic beast shape II_ if you know [_beast shape II_](/spells/beast-shape-ii), even if you don’t know _mythic beast shape I_). Each _mythic beast shape_ spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.  
  
The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4).  
  
**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round. For example, if you’re 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of _mythic beast shape_.">
