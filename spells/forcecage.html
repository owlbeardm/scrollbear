Like a [_wall of force_](/spells/wall-of-force), a _forcecage_ resists [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), although a [_mage's disjunction_](/spells/mage's-disjunction) still functions. The walls of a _forcecage_ can be damaged by spells as normal, except for [_disintegrate_](/spells/disintegrate), which automatically destroys it. The walls of a forcecage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but they have a Hardness of 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a _sphere of annihilation_ or _rod of cancellation_ instantly destroys a _forcecage_.  
  
_Barred Cage_: This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a [_wall of force_](/spells/wall-of-force) spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined within the barred cage. You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.  
  
_Windowless Cell_: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.">
