    Suppressing Stone - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="You infuse arcane power into the focus _ioun stone_, which must be currently floating around your head. If the _ioun stone_ ever ceases floating around you, the spell ends immediately, and the spell fails if the _ioun stone_ in question is cracked, burned, flawed, or otherwise of lesser value (such as a _dull gray ioun stone_). While the spell is active, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5 at caster level 20). Whenever you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or effect, you can burn out the focus, transforming it irrevocably into a _dull gray ioun stone_ and ending this spell, but suppressing the mind-affecting effect for 1 round per 2,500 gp of value of the focus (minimum 1 round). Rounds during which the effect is suppressed still count against its duration, and the effect can still be dispelled or disrupted during this time.">

  You infuse arcane power into the focus _ioun stone_, which must be currently floating around your head. If the _ioun stone_ ever ceases floating around you, the spell ends immediately, and the spell fails if the _ioun stone_ in question is cracked, burned, flawed, or otherwise of lesser value (such as a _dull gray ioun stone_). While the spell is active, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5 at caster level 20). Whenever you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or effect, you can burn out the focus, transforming it irrevocably into a _dull gray ioun stone_ and ending this spell, but suppressing the mind-affecting effect for 1 round per 2,500 gp of value of the focus (minimum 1 round). Rounds during which the effect is suppressed still count against its duration, and the effect can still be dispelled or disrupted during this time.
