  <meta name="Description" content="You don’t so much cast a _miracle_ as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.

A _miracle_ can do any of the following things.

*   Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.
*   Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
*   Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as [feeblemind](/spells/feeblemind) or [insanity](/spells/insanity).
*   Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.

Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a _miracle_ costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful _miracles_ of this sort could include the following:

*   Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
*   Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.
*   Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.

In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity’s (or alignment’s) nature is refused.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a _miracle_ spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.">

A _miracle_ can do any of the following things.

*   Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
*   Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as [feeblemind](/spells/feeblemind) or [insanity](/spells/insanity).
