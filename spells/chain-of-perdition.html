  <title>Chain of Perdition - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="A floating chain of force with hooks at each end appears within an unoccupied space of your choosing within range. This chain is a Medium object that has a 10-foot reach. Physical attacks cannot hit or harm the chain of perdition, but [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic), [disintegrate](/spells/disintegrate), a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it normally. The chain’s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric).

The chain can perform the dirty trick (blind or entangle), drag, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, using your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The chain does not provoke attacks of opportunity for making combat maneuvers. It suffers no penalty or miss chance due to [darkness](/spells/darkness), [invisibility](/spells/invisibility), or other forms of concealment.

As a move action, you can move the chain up to 30 feet. If the chain goes beyond the spell’s range or out of your sight, it returns to you.

If a creature that the chain attacks has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the chain performs a successful maneuver against that creature. If the chain is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

FAQ/Errata

The following is **NOT** errata, NOR an official FAQ. It is merely a post to the Paizo boards by this spell’s original designer meant to clarify his intent and concept when creating this spell. This information is presented merely to help understand how the designer intended it to work. As usual, how it ACTUALLY works is up to the GM.

“Actually, the basis of this spell is grasping hand, and since that is based upon interposing hand you’re going to see a lot of the same language used from that spell as well.

So, it is an auto-attacker, like grasping hand; but what the spell doesn’t say (and perhaps it should) is that designating a new target is a move action. The language concerning moving it within the 30-ft. range was added in editorial review.

The intent is the chain does one of the listed combat maneuvers once per round.

**FYI**: This was ultimately inspired by Marvel’s Ghost Rider, and a little bit of The Christmas Carol (i.e. Jacob Marley). As a force construct, it’s a way to drag around ghosts, shadows, spectres and the like. Of course, it has more applications than just that, but that’s where the name comes from.”

  A floating chain of force with hooks at each end appears within an unoccupied space of your choosing within range. This chain is a Medium object that has a 10-foot reach.
