Each _mythic monstrous physique_ spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic _monstrous physique_ spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know a lower-level _mythic monstrous physique_ spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn _mythic monstrous physique II_ if you know [_monstrous physique II_](/spells/monstrous-physique-ii), even if you don’t know _mythic monstrous physique I_). Each _mythic monstrous physique_ spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.  
  
The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2 each, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 each (minimum penalty of 0). Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature.  
  
**Augmented (4th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. Additionally, you can cast this spell on other willing creatures, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature per tier.">
