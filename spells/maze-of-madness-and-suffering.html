**Circus:** The creature finds itself in a nightmarish circus of giant beasts, garishly painted faces, and hideous, mocking laughter. The creature must succeed at a Will save or gain a lesser madness. The save uses the madness’s normal DC.

**Haunted Forest**: The creature travels through a dark forest of grasping trees while shadowy beasts prowl at the edge of its vision. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. This is a fear effect. A frightened creature can still attempt Intelligence checks to escape the maze, but it takes 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage from the trees’ branches.

**Hellscape**: The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become paralyzed by fear and potential torment for 1 round. This is a fear effect. The creature can’t attempt to escape the maze while paralyzed, and if it fails three consecutive saving throws against this paralysis, the hellscape delivers a coup de grace, dealing the creature 4d6 points of fire damage. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or die. A creature that survives the coup de grace escapes from the paralysis as well.

**Oasis of Respite**: Whether it appears as a beautiful glade, a perfumed palace, or a literal desert oasis, this section of the maze is supernaturally peaceful, especially in comparison to the rest of the maze. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. The creature can’t attempt to escape the maze while fascinated. A creature that fails three consecutive saving throws to this fascination enters a state of lethargy and gives up ever escaping the maze, remaining in this area until the spell ends on its own in 10 minutes (as per [maze](/spells/maze)).

**Strange City**: The creature journeys through a city of cyclopean architecture under a sky of indescribable color and numerous stars. The creature must succeed at a Will save or take 2d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity rules, the creature instead takes 2d10 points of sanity damage.">
