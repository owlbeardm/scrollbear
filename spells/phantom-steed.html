  <title>Phantom Steed - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horse-like creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

The mount is AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider’s weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount’s abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

**8th Level**: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

**10th Level**: The mount can use [water walk](/spells/water-walk) at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).

**12th Level**: The mount can use [air walk](/spells/air-walk) at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.

**14th Level**: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.">
