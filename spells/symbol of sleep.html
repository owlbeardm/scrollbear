    Symbol of Sleep - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the _symbol of sleep_ instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes. Unlike with the [_sleep_](/spells/sleep) spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.  
  
Unlike [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), _symbol of sleep_ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of sleep_ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of sleep_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol of sleep_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for _symbol of sleep_.">
