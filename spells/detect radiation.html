  You detect radiation in the surrounding area. You see radioactive auras as a glowing green shimmer in the air that emanates from radioactive objects; the brighter and more intense the green, the more powerful the radioactivity. This glow does not provide illumination or allow you to see in darkness, apart from being able to see the glow itself. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it—although radiation can seep into such barriers, causing them to become radioactive (and thus visible to the spell) in time.
