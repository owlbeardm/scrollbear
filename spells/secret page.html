  <meta name="Description" content="_Secret page_ alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. [_Explosive runes_](/spells/explosive-runes) or [_sepia snake sigil_](/spells/sepia-snake-sigil) can be cast upon the _secret page_.  
  
A [_comprehend languages_](/spells/comprehend-languages) spell alone cannot reveal a _secret page_'s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return it to its _secret page_ form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A [_detect magic_](/spells/detect-magic) spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. [_True seeing_](/spells/true-seeing) reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with [_comprehend languages_](/spells/comprehend-languages). A _secret page_ spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an [_erase_](/spells/erase) spell.">
