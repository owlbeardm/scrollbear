  <meta name="Description" content="An immobile, blinding curtain of white light that blocks line of sight springs into existence. The wall sheds bright light to a range of 60 feet in all directions. A creature adjacent to the wall is blinded as long as it remains adjacent plus an additional 1d4 rounds thereafter-closing its eyes or succeeding at a Fortitude save negates the effect for 1 round. A creature that passes through the wall is automatically blinded, even if its eyes are closed. A creature from the Plane of Shadow gains 1d4 negative levels each round it spends within 5 feet of the wall (Fortitude negates). Passing through the wall imposes a -4 penalty on the save for that round. Twenty-four hours after gaining these negative levels, the subject must attempt a new Fortitude saving throw for each negative level. If a save succeeds, 1 negative level is removed. If it fails, the negative level becomes permanent. Wall of light can be made permanent with [_permanency_](/spells/permanency) (with a minimum caster level of 13th and cost of 11,000 gp).">
