    Symbol of Distraction - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), except that all creatures within the radius of a _symbol of distraction_ instead become fascinated by the symbol for 10 minutes per caster level. Unlike [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), _symbol of distraction_ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of distraction_ simply remains active for a duration of 10 minutes × your caster level. All fascinated creatures move toward the _symbol of distraction_, trying to remain within the symbol’s area of effect. If the symbol leads affected creatures into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature can attempt an additional Will saving throw, with success indicating it is no longer fascinated. If a creature’s view of the symbol is completely blocked, it is immediately freed of the symbol’s effect.">
