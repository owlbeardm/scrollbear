Also, your wings give you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.  
  
Protective aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures to anyone within 20 feet. Otherwise, it functions as a [_magic circle against evil_](/spells/magic-circle-against-evil) and a [_lesser globe of invulnerability_](/spells/globe-of-invulnerability--lesser), both with a radius of 20 feet.  
  
Truespeech allows you to speak with any creature that has a language, as though using the [_tongues_](/spells/tongues) spell.">
