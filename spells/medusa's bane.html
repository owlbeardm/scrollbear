As an immediate action, you can reflect a creature’s gaze back on itself, forcing the target of the gaze attack to save against its own gaze weapon or be affected by it. This reflection bypasses the typical immunity creatures with gaze attacks have to their own race’s gaze attack, but does not bypass any other resistances or immunities the creature might have.
