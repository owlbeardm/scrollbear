  <meta name="Description" content="Dark gray smoke seeps from your eyes, ears, and mouth for the spell’s duration, though the smoke doesn’t significantly hamper your vision. Upon casting the spell, you may immediately exhale the smoke in a 30-foot cone or do so in a later round as a standard action, ending the spell. Each living creature caught within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round per caster level as it is wracked with waves of nausea and disorienting visions. If it succeeds at its Fortitude save, the creature is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds.  
  
If you don’t expel the smoke by the end of the spell’s duration, you suffer the spell’s effects instead.  
  
If you cast [_augury_](/spells/augury) during the duration of _hallucinogenic smoke_, treat your caster level as 5 higher when determining the chance for a meaningful reply. Additionally, you know whether a result of “nothing” resulted from a failed or successful [_augury_](/spells/augury).">
