    Geas, Lesser - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="A _lesser geas_ places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.  
  
The _geased_ creature must follow the given instructions until the _geas_ is completed, no matter how long it takes.  
  
If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.  
  
If the subject is prevented from obeying the _lesser geas_ for 24 hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the _lesser geas_.  
  
A _lesser geas_ (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by [_break enchantment_](/spells/break-enchantment), [_limited wish_](/spells/limited-wish), [_remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse), [_miracle_](/spells/miracle), or [_wish_](/spells/wish). [_Dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) does not affect a _lesser geas_.">
