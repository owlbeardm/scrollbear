  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), except it instead creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates function as [_mirror image_](/spells/mirror-image), moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creature’s turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
_Symbol of mirroring_ can be made permanent with a [_permanency_](/spells/permanency) spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.">
