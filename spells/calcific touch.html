  Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. [_Break enchantment_](/spells/break-enchantment), [_restoration_](/spells/restoration), or [_stone to flesh_](/spells/stone-to-flesh) can reverse the effects of _calcific touch_.
