  <meta name="Description" content="You create an illusory duplicate of the target item. If you hold the charge on this spell, you can deliver it while touching an object you steal with Sleight of Hand or a stealAPG combat maneuver; in this case, the illusion phases into existence exactly as you remove the genuine article, allowing you to instantaneously replace a protected or guarded item with no change in appearance, weight, or other factors.  
  
The illusion appears to be a perfect replica. Actively examining the fake with an Appraise or Perception check grants a creature a Will save, but on a failed saving throw, it concludes that the fake is the genuine article. The illusion isn’t a functional item, nor does it have any magical properties of the original. For example, an instant fake of a set of thieves’ tools can’t be used to pick a lock, a false warhammer can’t harm a person or break an object, a suit of unreal chainmail offers no actual protection, and an illusory potion of [_cure light wounds_](/spells/cure-light-wounds) doesn’t heal any hit points when imbibed.">
