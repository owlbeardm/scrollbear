  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_dimension door_](/spells/dimension-door), except you leave behind a burst of fire. Choose one corner of your starting square. A 10-foot-radius burst of flame explodes from that corner the moment you leave, dealing 4d6 points of fire damage.

The burst of fire created reeks of sulfur and brimstone and also acts like [_stinking cloud_](/spells/stinking-cloud) (with the same duration as that spell and a separate Fortitude save).  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you bring one unwilling adjacent creature with you. You may bring additional creatures, but each must be adjacent to you and each requires you to expend one additional use of mythic power. These creatures must first attempt a saving throw against the burst of flame and [_stinking cloud_](/spells/stinking-cloud), then can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being teleported with you.">
