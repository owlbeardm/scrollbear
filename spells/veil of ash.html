  <meta name="Description" content="This spell causes a small cloud of searing, choking ash to appear around the face of the target. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 points of fire damage and be blinded. The victim must make a new save against damage and blindness for each round the spell persists. The target must have a discernable anatomy and no more than one head in order to be blinded.
