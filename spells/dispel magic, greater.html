    Dispel Magic, Greater - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures.  
  
You choose to use _greater dispel magic_ in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell:  
  
_Targeted Dispel_: This functions as a targeted [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.  
  
Additionally, _greater dispel magic_ has a chance to dispel any effect that [_remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse) can remove, even if [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.  
  
_Area Dispel_: When _greater dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic). For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.  
  
For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the _greater dispel magic spell_, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the _greater dispel magic_ spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.  
  
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by _summon monster_) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.  
  
You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.  
  
_Counterspell_: This functions as [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.">
