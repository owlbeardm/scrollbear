  <meta name="Description" content="You mark a subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of undesirable behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of [_bestow curse_](/spells/bestow-curse).  
  
Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained.  
  
Like the effect of [_bestow curse_](/spells/bestow-curse), a _mark of justice_ cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a [_break enchantment_](/spells/break-enchantment), [_limited wish_](/spells/limited-wish), [_miracle_](/spells/miracle), [_remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse), or [_wish_](/spells/wish) spell. [_Remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse) works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your mark of justice caster level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated.">
