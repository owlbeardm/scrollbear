  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as [_contingency_](/spells/contingency), but you invest a spell whose level doesn’t exceed one-quarter of your level (rounded down, maximum spell level 3rd) into one of your implements that holds 2 or more points of mental focus. The spell’s school must match that of the implement, and the spell must be one that affects only your person. Casting _talismanic implement_ reduces the selected implement’s mental focus by 2, including for the purposes of determining the effects of resonant powers. When you refresh your mental focus, _talismanic implement_ ends automatically, even if the duration hasn’t elapsed. Unlike contingency, you may have multiple _talismanic implements_ simultaneously, though a single implement can hold only one _talismanic implement_ spell, and if you have any _talismanic implements_, you can’t have any other kind of [_contingency_](/spells/contingency) in effect.">

  This spell functions as [_contingency_](/spells/contingency), but you invest a spell whose level doesn’t exceed one-quarter of your level (rounded down, maximum spell level 3rd) into one of your implements that holds 2 or more points of mental focus. The spell’s school must match that of the implement, and the spell must be one that affects only your person. Casting _talismanic implement_ reduces the selected implement’s mental focus by 2, including for the purposes of determining the effects of resonant powers. When you refresh your mental focus, _talismanic implement_ ends automatically, even if the duration hasn’t elapsed.
