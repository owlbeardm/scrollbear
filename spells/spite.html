  <meta name="Description" content="Choose a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower with a casting time of 1 standard action or less. As part of the action of casting _spite_, you cast the associated spell and bind it into a defensive ward in the form of a tattoo, birthmark, or wart somewhere upon your body. The next time you are hit by a melee attack or a combat maneuver is used successfully against you, the stored spell is triggered against your foe. You do not need to succeed on a touch attack to affect the target, but in all other respects the spell is treated as though you had cast it normally. If the attacking creature is not a valid target for the spell, the stored spell is lost with no effect.  
  
You can have only one _spite_ spell in effect at a time; if you cast this spell a second time, the previous spell effect ends.">
