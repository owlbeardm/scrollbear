  <meta name="Description" content="You become invisible (as [_greater invisibility_](/spells/invisibility--greater), a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as [_major image_](/spells/major-image), a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.  
  
The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The greater invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.

You create one illusory double per 5 caster levels, each of which appears in your square or in an unoccupied square adjacent to yours. When you cast the spell, you can give each of these doubles a simple programmed task as a telepathic command, such a “walk south,” “beg for mercy,” or “follow that troll.”  
  
You can change or modify a single illusory double’s programmed task by spending a swift, move, or standard action; this requires concentration.  
  
**Augmented (4th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, this spell also grants you the benefits of augmented _mythic invisibility_ instead of [_greater invisibility_](/spells/invisibility--greater).">
