_3rd Round_: The strength and location of each undead aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.  
  
_Aura Strength_: The strength of an undead aura is determined by the HD of the undead creature, as given on the table below.  
  
_Lingering Aura_: An undead aura lingers after its original source is destroyed.
