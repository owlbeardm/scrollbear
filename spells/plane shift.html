  <meta name="Description" content="You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the _plane shift_ at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. _Plane shift_ transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting _plane shift_ again).

If you’ve been to the destination plane and are familiar with a location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant transported creatures the effects of a [_planar adaptation_](/spells/planar-adaptation) spell (_Advanced Player’s Guide_ 236) upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.">
