  <meta name="Description" content="A _bow spirit_ is a shapeless force that hovers about you, taking ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as the _bow spirit_ lasts, you can spend a swift action to direct the _bow spirit_ to fire an arrow or a bolt at a target of your choice, as if the _bow spirit_ were firing the necessary ranged weapon. The _bow spirit_ uses your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier, as well as any bonuses and effects from feats you have that affect ranged attacks, or bonuses from the ammunition it uses. A _bow spirit’s_ attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity. There must be ammunition available for the _bow spirit_ to use, and it expends ammunition as if used by you.  
  
A _bow spirit_ occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), [_disintegrate_](/spells/disintegrate), a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. A _bow spirit’s_ AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.">
