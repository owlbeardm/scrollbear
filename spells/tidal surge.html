    Tidal Surge - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="If you cast _tidal surge_ on land, you create an onrushing surge of water 10 feet high in a 30-foot cone that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level) and extinguishes all nonmagical fires in the area. Magical fire effects in the area of a _tidal surge_ are affected as if you had cast [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic). In addition to taking damage, creatures that fail their Reflex saves are pushed 1d4×5 feet away from you, and Medium or smaller creatures are also knocked prone.  
  
If you cast this spell in or on a body of water at least 30 feet across, you can shape the spell either as the cone described above or as a 60-foot line. In either shape, the water deals 1d10 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have in addition to pushing away creatures that fail their Reflex saves.">
