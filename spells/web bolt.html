  You launch a ball of webbing at a target, which must make a save or be affected as if by a [_web_](/spells/web) spell occupying only the creature’s space. If the creature saves or breaks free of the webbing, the remaining webs dissolve and the square is not considered difficult terrain. The spell has no effect if the target is not on or adjacent to a solid surface that can support the webbing.
