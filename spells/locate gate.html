Locate gate can be blocked by spells like [_nondetection_](/spells/nondetection), if the effect originates from a specific object or creature. However, spell effects can’t likewise be warded. For example, _ring gates_ are a specific object, but a permanent [_teleportation circle_](/spells/teleportation-circle) is not (the surface in which it’s inscribed doesn’t count). _Locate gate_ isn’t blocked by lead, water, or other physical environmental conditions, but it is blocked by any intervening area that is dimensionally warded (such as by [_dimensional lock_](/spells/dimensional-lock) or [_forbiddance_](/spells/forbiddance)).">
