A creature need only succeed at one saving throw to move through all pillars created by this spell.  
  
A creature standing within the area of a pillar is dazzled (no save), while a creature making a ranged attack that passes through one or more of the illusory pillars takes a 50% miss chance. A creature can make a melee attack against a target within a pillar at no penalty.">
