  <meta name="Description" content="This potent spell invokes the same sort of magical devastation that created the Mana Wastes so long ago— albeit on a much more localized (and thankfully temporary) scale. Within the area you choose to affect with _spellscar_, the terrain takes on a strange pale hue, as if colors were muted. Periodically, ripples of vibrant color wriggle through the terrain. Within this area, any spell, spell-like ability, or magic item activation automatically triggers a primal magic event—a spellcaster can avoid triggering such an event by making a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell’s level), but non-spellcasters who activate magic items have no such option.  
  
You gain a +4 insight bonus on concentration checks made to avoid triggering primal magic events while within a _spellscar_ you have created, and if you do trigger a primal magic event, you may roll d% twice and pick which of the two results you wish to have occur.">
