  <meta name="Description" content="You summon a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders (your choice), which attacks all other creatures within its area. (You may summon the swarm so that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures are within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. The caster has no control over its target or direction of travel.

The swarm has the advanced simple template. A swarm of rats or spiders leaves behind a trail of filth or ichor when it moves, which has the effects of a grease spell for 1 round after the swarm passes through an area. Any creature that moves through the affected area is also subject to the swarm’s disease or poison, as if attacked by the swarm. A prone creature in the affected area takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw against this affliction. A bat swarm leaves behind a similar trail that lasts for 2 rounds but doesn’t have a disease or poison effect.">
