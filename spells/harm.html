  <meta name="Description" content="_Harm_ charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, _harm_ deals half this amount. _Harm_ cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.
