If you sleep with this spell prepared, you may automatically expend it while you sleep to gain the spell’s benefit. This expenditure does not count as spellcasting for the purpose of determining available spell slots (you could go to sleep at midnight, expend this spell during an 8-hour period of sleep, and still prepare your full allotment of spells in the morning).">
