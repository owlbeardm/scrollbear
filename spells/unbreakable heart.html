  <meta name="Description" content="The target creature gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that rely on negative emotions (such as [_crushing despair_](/spells/crushing-despair), [_rage_](/spells/rage), or fear effects) or that would force him to harm an ally (such as [_confusion_](/spells/confusion)). If the target is already under such an effect when receiving this spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of this spell. It does not affect mind-affecting effects based on positive emotions (such as [_good hope_](/spells/good-hope) or the inspire courage bard ability). A creature can still be charmed or otherwise magically controlled while under this spell’s effects, but if such a creature ever receives a new saving throw against that effect as a result of being ordered to attempt to harm or otherwise oppose a true ally, he can roll that saving throw twice and take the better result as his actual roll.
