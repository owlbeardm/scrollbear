If the _desecrated_ area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 profane bonus to negative channeled energy DCs, +2 profane bonus and +2 hit points per HD for undead created in the area).  
  
Furthermore, anyone who casts [_animate dead_](/spells/animate-dead) within this area may create as many as double the normal amount of undead (that is, 4 HD per caster level rather than 2 HD per caster level).  
  
If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the _desecrate_ spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power.
