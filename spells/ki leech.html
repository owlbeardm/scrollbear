    Ki Leech - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a critical hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can steal some of that creature’s ki. This replenishes 1 point of _ki_ as long as you have at least 1 _ki_ point in your _ki_ pool. This does not allow you to exceed your _ki_ pool’s maximum. This ability does not stack with similar abilities (such as the steal _ki_ ability of the hungry ghost monk).  
  
This spell has no effect if you do not have a _ki_ pool.">
