If a target fails its Reflex save, it becomes enclosed in the _light prison_. A creature enclosed in a _light prison_ can attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally as long as it stays within the _light prison_. However, if a creature passes through the walls of a _light prison_ enclosing it, it takes 1d6 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round. Creatures do not receive saves to negate these effects. Once a creature passes through the walls of a _light prison_ surrounding it, the effect ends for that creature.">
