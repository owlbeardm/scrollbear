    Grease - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="A _grease_ spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.  
  
The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the _greased_ item. A creature wearing _greased_ armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.

If you cast _mythic grease_ on an area, add your tier to the Acrobatics DC to move within or through the area. If you cast it on a creature’s armor or clothing, add your tier to its Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks attempted to escape a grapple and to its CMD to avoid being grappled.  
  
**Augmented**: You can expend two uses of mythic power to make the grease flammable. It ignites from any fire at least the size of a candle flame. If a greased area is ignited, any creature in the area on your turn takes 1d3 points of fire damage and might catch on fire (_Core Rulebook_ 444). If a greased creature is ignited, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage, and might catch on fire; add your tier to the save DC.">
