If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell ends.  
  
If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.  
  
You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You always fail Reflex and Will saving throws, for example.)  
  
Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or dream are immune to this spell.

The spell’s damage increases to 4d6 points of damage, and the target is also shaken for 24 hours.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: You can deliver a mind-affecting spell through a _mythic nightmare_. The maximum level of the delivered spell is equal to half your tier, and you must expend one use of mythic power for each spell level of the imbued spell in addition to the one use needed to cast _mythic nightmare_. You choose whether the delivered spell affects the creature immediately or when it awakens. The delivered spell affects only the target, even if it normally affects multiple creatures or an area.">
