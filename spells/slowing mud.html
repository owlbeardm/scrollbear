    Slowing Mud - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a [_slow_](/spells/slow) spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the slow effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as [_create water_](/spells/create-water) or [_hydraulic push_](/spells/hydraulic-push)) removes all the mud in 1 round.  
  
A [_haste_](/spells/haste) effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the [_haste_](/spells/haste). Slow does not stack with the effects of _slowing mud_. This spell cannot counter or dispel [_haste_](/spells/haste).">

  You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a [_slow_](/spells/slow) spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the slow effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as [_create water_](/spells/create-water) or [_hydraulic push_](/spells/hydraulic-push)) removes all the mud in 1 round.  
  
A [_haste_](/spells/haste) effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the [_haste_](/spells/haste). Slow does not stack with the effects of _slowing mud_. This spell cannot counter or dispel [_haste_](/spells/haste).
