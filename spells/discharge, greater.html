    Discharge, Greater - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as [_discharge_](/spells/discharge), except it can discharge multiple technological objects and can be used to target an area.  
  
You choose to use _greater discharge_ in one of two ways: an area discharge or a targeted discharge.  
  
_Area Discharge_: When _greater discharge_ is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creature’s possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.  
  
_Targeted Discharge_: This spell functions as [_discharge_](/spells/discharge), but if the target is a creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the target’s charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you possess.">
