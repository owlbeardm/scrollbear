The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over.

The ambrosial food grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and Will saves and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against poison and fear effects for 12 hours.  
  
If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.">
