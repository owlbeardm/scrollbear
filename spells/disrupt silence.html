Additionally, _disrupt silence_ can automatically counter or dispel any magical silence effect of equal or lower level cast upon the same target, such as [_silence_](/spells/silence). If you cast _disrupt silence_ on the target of a higher-level silence effect, it functions as [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) instead of its normal function.">
