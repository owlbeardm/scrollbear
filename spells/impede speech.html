  This minor curse interferes with the target’s ability to speak. On a failed save, the target has difficulty stringing words together. Only with great concentration can he communicate intelligibly. Speaking in combat becomes a move-equivalent action rather than a free action. If the target attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, he has a 50% chance of making an error and losing the spell. Even if he can successfully cast a spell, doing so takes 1 round if the spell’s normal casting time is less than 1 round. If the spell’s casting time is usually 1 round or longer, its casting time doubles (up until the end of _impede speech_). _Impede speech_ cannot be dispelled, but [_break enchantment_](/spells/break-enchantment), [_limited wish_](/spells/limited-wish), [_miracle_](/spells/miracle), [_remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse), or [_wish_](/spells/wish) can end it prematurely.
