  <meta name="Description" content="This spell causes a brushy beard of stiff iron to erupt from the face of a willing target. The _ironbeard_ grants a +1 armor bonus to AC, and this bonus stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The _ironbeard_ may also be used as a weapon equivalent to cold iron armor spikes. The _ironbeard_ makes it difficult to speak, so any spellcasting with a verbal component has a 20% spell failure chance.">
