  <meta name="Description" content="This spell allows remote viewing through spheres that have previously consumed some portion of the spellcaster’s body: a single digit of a finger or toe at a minimum. The caster can view and listen to events within a 20-foot radius of the associated sphere; this radius follows the sphere if the sphere moves. Unlike a true [_scrying_](/spells/scrying) spell, no other spells operate through the associated sphere, but _spherescry_ produces no indication of its activity on the target and cannot be discovered by normal methods of magical detection.">
