A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is partially petrified, becoming slowed (as the [_slow_](/spells/slow) spell) for a number of rounds equal to your tier. The creature can end this effect early by spending a full-round action breaking away its own petrified flesh, dealing 5d10 points of damage to itself. Any effect that removes or reverses petrification negates this partial petrification and the [_slow_](/spells/slow) effect. The spell can affect objects and undead, as long as the target is primarily made of flesh or bone, such as a corpse or zombie. The spell doesn’t affect the target’s gear. If cast on a creature with equipment, the creature transforms into stone but its gear doesn’t.  
  
**Augmented (9th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any Large or smaller creature fully petrified by the spell immediately animates and follows your commands, as if you had cast [_animate objects_](/spells/animate-objects).">
