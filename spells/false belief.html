  You temporarily alter the target’s memory (similar to [_modify memory_](/spells/modify-memory)) to eliminate, change, or implant a memory of up to 1 hour in length. When the duration of this expires, the target’s real memory returns, and the false memory fades to little more than a vague outline, like a dream. This false memory seems true to the target, so effects that detect lies or force the target to speak the truth (as the subject understands it) don’t detect the falsehood.
