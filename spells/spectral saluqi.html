    Spectral Saluqi - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell creates a spectral saluqi, an undead canine resembling an oversized hound with black fur, a gray ruff and tail, and milky gray eyes. The hound shares your alignment and can converse with you telepathically. It can see and attack ethereal creatures, and otherwise has the same statistics as a yeth hound (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 286). It usually leaves no tracks because it prefers to fly an inch above the ground. You are immune to the hound’s bay ability. The hound’s bite is considered aligned to any single alignment you possess for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.">
