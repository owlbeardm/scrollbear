  <meta name="Description" content="You instill the target with an intense, instinctual fear of a condition or circumstance, more powerful than the phobia lesser madness. You can name an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), a hazard (such as an avalanche or earthquake), or a single creature of the animal type or all vermin (applying when the target sees a swarm or a single Small or larger creature). Alternatively, you can name the following specific environments: darkness (darker than dim light, and you can’t apply this phobia to a creature with natural racial darkvision, see in darkness, blindsight, or similar senses), enclosed spaces (places that require the creature to squeeze),heights (10 times the target’s height, and you can’t apply this phobia to creatures with a natural fly speed), or water (you can’t apply this phobia to aquatic creatures or creatures with a natural swim speed).

When the target takes damage of the energy type (for an energy type phobia), or perceives the presence of the creature, environment, or hazard, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it fails, it becomes panicked, but even if it succeeds, it becomes shaken and feels intensely uncomfortable; a creature shaken in this way does not need to roll further saving throws against its phobia until its shaken condition ends, even if it continues to be exposed to its phobia.

A creature panicked by _phobia_ can begin to act normally 1 minute after it ceases being able to perceive its _phobia_ or after taking the energy damage if the phobia is an energy type, though the shaken condition ends immediately after the creature can no longer perceive its phobia. [Break enchantment](/spells/break-enchantment), [heal](/spells/heal), [limited wish](/spells/limited-wish), [miracle](/spells/miracle), or [wish](/spells/wish) can remove a _phobia_ spell.">

  You instill the target with an intense, instinctual fear of a condition or circumstance, more powerful than the phobia lesser madness. You can name an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), a hazard (such as an avalanche or earthquake), or a single creature of the animal type or all vermin (applying when the target sees a swarm or a single Small or larger creature). Alternatively, you can name the following specific environments: darkness (darker than dim light, and you can’t apply this phobia to a creature with natural racial darkvision, see in darkness, blindsight, or similar senses), enclosed spaces (places that require the creature to squeeze),heights (10 times the target’s height, and you can’t apply this phobia to creatures with a natural fly speed), or water (you can’t apply this phobia to aquatic creatures or creatures with a natural swim speed).

When the target takes damage of the energy type (for an energy type phobia), or perceives the presence of the creature, environment, or hazard, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it fails, it becomes panicked, but even if it succeeds, it becomes shaken and feels intensely uncomfortable; a creature shaken in this way does not need to roll further saving throws against its phobia until its shaken condition ends, even if it continues to be exposed to its phobia.
