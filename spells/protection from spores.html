    Protection from Spores - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="With a touch, you bolster a creature’s body to protect it from the harmful effects of spores and similar afflictions. While under the effect of this spell, a creature is immune to the effects of brown mold, green slime, russet mold, yellow mold, and any similar hazard, provided the hazard is CR 6 or lower. Similarly, the creature is immune to poison, disease, and infestation attacks from all fungal creatures of CR 6 or lower, including effects such as basidirond spores, violet fungus rot, and the like. The target is immune to fungus-based toxins, such as striped toadstool. Against similar hazards or monsters of CR 7 or higher, the target gains a bonus on all saving throws against the effect equal to half your caster level. _Protection from spores_ offers no protection against fungal infestations created by the seeded, by the spell [_what grows within_](/spells/what-grows-within), or by Xhamen-Dor.">
