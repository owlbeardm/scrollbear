  <meta name="Description" content="This spell animates a tree’s branch and directs it against your foes. At caster level 10th or lower, you can target a Huge tree. At caster level 11th–15th, you can target a Gargantuan tree, and at caster level 16th or higher you can target a Colossal tree. The animated branch makes slam attacks with a Strength score equal to 10 + your caster level. The branch strikes once per round with an attack bonus equal to your caster level + the branch’s Strength modifier, adjusted by the appropriate size modifier (–2 for Huge, –4 for Gargantuan, –8 for Colossal). A Huge tree’s slam deals 2d6 points of damage, a Gargantuan tree’s slam deals 3d6 points of damage, and a Colossal tree’s slam deals 4d6 points of damage; the tree adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to this damage. A Huge tree has reach 15 feet, a Gargantuan has reach 20 feet, and a Colossal has reach 30 feet. The tree attacks the creature you designate when you cast the spell, and is unable to move. You can direct the tree against a new target as a move action. The tree does not gain a bonus for flanking, nor can it help another combatant flank. It cannot attack a foe you cannot see.

You animate two branches instead of one, allowing the tree to attack twice per round. Add your tier to your caster level when determining the tree’s Strength score. A creature struck by both slam attacks in the same round must succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell’s DC or be staggered for 1 round.  
  
**Augmented (7th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the tree attempts three slam attacks per round and its slams bypass all damage reduction. A creature struck by all three slam attacks in the same round is stunned for 1 round and staggered for 1d4 rounds after the stun ends. A successful Fortitude save negates the stun and reduces the duration of being staggered by half.">
