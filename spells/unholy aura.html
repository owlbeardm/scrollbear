First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of [_protection from good_](/spells/protection-from-good), this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures.  
  
Second, a warded creature gains SR 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures.  
  
Third, the abjuration protects the subjects from possession and mental influence, just as [_protection from good_](/spells/protection-from-good) does.  
  
Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (Fortitude negates).">
