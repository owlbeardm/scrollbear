The ground in the area is covered in ice and hailstones, acting as though a [_grease_](/spells/grease) spell were cast on it.

**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, one creature in the area is paralyzed (as if by [_hold person_](/spells/hold-person)) and gains vulnerability to fire as long as it’s paralyzed.">
