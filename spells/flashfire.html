A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save negates the damage and avoids catching on fire. The area and all adjacent 5-foot squares are smoky, providing concealment within. You can concentrate as a standard action to ignite one 5-foot square adjacent to a currently burning square. Heavy precipitation (including [_sleet storm_](/spells/sleet-storm)) ends the spell.
