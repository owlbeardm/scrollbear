    Giant Vermin - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider). The number of vermin which can be affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on the table below.  
  
Giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (“Attack,” “Defend,” “Stop,” and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them.

The vermin you transform with this spell gain DR 5/magic and either the advanced creature template or the giant creature template (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 294, 295).  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, any vermin you transform also gains either the agile (see page 224) or savage mythic template (see page 224) while the spell lasts.  
  
If you’re at least 9th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the duration changes to instantaneous, meaning the vermin retain their giant size. After a number of days equal to your tier, you lose control over the vermin unless you have some other way of controlling them, and they lose the agile or savage mythic template but retain the advanced or giant creature template.">
