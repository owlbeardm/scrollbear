    Hostile Levitation - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid footing and halving the target’s speed. The target also takes a –4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 penalty on attack rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.  
  
This spell fails if cast on a flying creature.">
