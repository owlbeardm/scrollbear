  <meta name="Description" content="_Shatter_ creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.  
  
Used as an area attack, _shatter_ destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such unattended objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.  
  
Alternatively, you can target _shatter_ against a single solid nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), _shatter_ deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.

Add your tier to your caster level when determining the maximum object weight you can affect. When targeting a crystalline creature, the spell’s damage increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). You may damage a single magical object as if it were a crystalline creature. If the spell destroys an object or damages a crystalline creature, broken shards litter the spell area or creature’s space and act as caltrops.">
