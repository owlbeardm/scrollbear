_Magic Item_: The item functions intermittently, gaining either an unreliable curse or a random dependent curse (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 536).  
  
_Nonmagical Armor or Shield_: The item gains the fragile armor quality (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment_ 8).  
  
_Nonmagical Weapon_: The item gains the fragile weapon quality (_Ultimate Equipment_ 22).  
  
_Tool_: The item gains the broken condition if a creature rolls a natural 1 while making a skill check with the tool.  
  
_Other Item_: Each day it is used, the item has a 5% chance of gaining the broken condition.  
  
This spell does not affect artifacts. The item can be sold or discarded as normal (the bearer is not compelled to keep it).
