The creature is aware of the message and who the recipient is.

Attempts to read the target’s mind (such as with [_detect thoughts_](/spells/detect-thoughts)) or to force the target to reveal the message (such as with torture or magical compulsion) likewise cause temporary amnesia regarding the message.  
  
The target can communicate the message only to someone it believes is the intended recipient, which means that disguises, illusions, and polymorph effects might fool the target into delivering the message.
