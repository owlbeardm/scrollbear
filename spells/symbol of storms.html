  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), except that when triggered, a 30-foot-radius centered on the symbol fills with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). Each round, a bolt of lightning that deals 10d6 points of electricity damage strikes a random creature within the area. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. Unlike [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), symbol of storms has no hit point limit. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 30 feet from a _symbol of storms_ can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once triggered, a _symbol of storms_ remains active for 1 minute per caster level.">
