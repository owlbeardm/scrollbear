  <meta name="Description" content="_Heal_ enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.  
  
_Heal_ does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.  
  
If used against an undead creature, _heal_ instead acts like [_harm_](/spells/harm).

#### Mythic Heal

The damage cured increases to 15 points of damage per caster level (maximum 225 points).  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell also acts as [_restoration_](/spells/restoration).">
