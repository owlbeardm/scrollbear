    Divination - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="Similar to [_augury_](/spells/augury) but more powerful, a _divination_ spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct _divination_ is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.  
  
As with [_augury_](/spells/augury), multiple _divinations_ about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first _divination_ spell and yield the same answer each time.">
