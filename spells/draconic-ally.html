Treat this servant as a pseudodragon with all of the abilities granted by one of the following spells: [form of the alien dragon I](/spells/form-of-the-alien-dragon-i-iii), [form of the dragon I](/spells/form-of-the-dragon), or [form of the exotic dragon I](/spells/form-of-the-exotic-dragon-i-iii). Your draconic ally can use its breath weapon once per day. Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell’s range, and can go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command. The draconic ally speaks one language of your choice that you know. You cannot have more than one draconic ally at a time. As long as a previous ally exists, you cannot successfully cast this spell again. If you have a breath weapon, you can cast this spell as a standard action by expending one use of your breath weapon as a free action when you cast the spell.

Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship a god of dragons add this spell to their spell lists as a 3rd-level spell.">

  You create a semi-living intelligent draconic servant that loyally obeys and serves you.

Treat this servant as a pseudodragon with all of the abilities granted by one of the following spells: [form of the alien dragon I](/spells/form-of-the-alien-dragon-i-iii), [form of the dragon I](/spells/form-of-the-dragon), or [form of the exotic dragon I](/spells/form-of-the-exotic-dragon-i-iii). Your draconic ally can use its breath weapon once per day. Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell’s range, and can go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command. The draconic ally speaks one language of your choice that you know. You cannot have more than one draconic ally at a time. As long as a previous ally exists, you cannot successfully cast this spell again. If you have a breath weapon, you can cast this spell as a standard action by expending one use of your breath weapon as a free action when you cast the spell.

Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship a god of dragons add this spell to their spell lists as a 3rd-level spell.
