  <meta name="Description" content="This spell surrounds you in a spout of clear acid that aids in deflecting attacks and damages creatures that attack you in melee. The constantly upward-rushing waters grant you a measure of protecting, shielding you so you only take half damage from acid and fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.  
  
Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.">
