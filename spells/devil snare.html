  Your touch creates an invisible circle on a flat surface. Any outsider passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught within. Once trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard action to physically exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any form of extradimensional travel (as per [_dimensional anchor_](/spells/dimensional-anchor)). Contained outsiders can still attack adjacent creatures outside of the circle, or target others with ranged attacks, spells, and spell-like abilities. Despite the spell’s name, _devil snare_ captures outsiders of any type, not only devils.  
  
As a standard action, you can dismiss the circle, expelling any outsiders still trapped within to their planes of origin (as per [_dismissal_](/spells/dismissal)). An outsider can resist this effect with a successful Will save, enabling it to remain after the spell is dismissed.
