After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.  
  
_Regenerate_ also cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including undead).

The casting time changes to 1 standard action and the target changes to 1 living creature or corpse touched. The spell removes the blinded, dazzled, and deafened conditions. The target gains regeneration equal to your tier (overcome by acid and fire) for 1 round per caster level. If the target was killed by amputation or decapitation (such as from a vorpal weapon) within the past 1 round, the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings the creature back to life (as [_breath of life_](/spells/breath-of-life)), treating it as if it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.">
