  <meta name="Description" content="You suffuse one subject’s body with energy from the Shadow Plane, altering its form to match a creature from the Shadow Plane. Shadow transmutation can mimic any of the following spells: [_animal growth_](/spells/animal-growth), [_anthropomorphic animal_](/spells/anthropomorphic-animal)UM, [_enlarge person_](/spells/enlarge-person), [_fins to feet_](/spells/fins-to-feet)ARG, _longarm_ACG, [_polymorph_](/spells/polymorph), [_reduce person_](/spells/reduce-person), and [_stone fist_](/spells/stone-fist). If using _shadow transmutation_ as [_polymorph_](/spells/polymorph), the target does not gain any sensory abilities that its new form has (such as lowlight vision or darkvision) and the speed of any movement types gained from the spell cannot exceed the target’s base speed or natural speed with those movement types (whichever is higher). A creature under the effects of _shadow transmutation_ deals normal damage and has all the normal abilities and weaknesses of whatever form it assumes using the spell.  
  
Any creature that interacts with a target under the effects of the spell (including attacking or being attacked by that creature) can attempt a Will save to recognize the target’s true nature. Creatures that succeed at their Will saves to disbelieve the illusion take one-fifth (20%) of the normal damage from the target’s natural attacks or special abilities granted by the target’s shadowy form (if any), and the target’s special abilities that don’t deal damage have only a 20% chance of working against them. Creatures that succeed at their saves see the _shadow transmutation_ as transparent images superimposed over the target.">
