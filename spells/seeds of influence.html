The target takes a –2 penalty on saving throws against divination spells you cast. You can target that creature with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than _seeds of influence_ as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the modified spell doesn’t take longer to cast and doesn’t use a higher-level spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast, _seeds of influence_ ends for that target. A creature can be subject to only one _seeds of influence_ spell at a time; later castings of _seeds of influence_ remove any previous casting.">
