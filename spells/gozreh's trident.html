You wield this spear-like bolt as if it were a trident (you are considered proficient with the bolt). Attacks with _Gozreh’s trident_ are melee touch attacks. The bolt deals 1d8 points of electricity damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). Since the bolt is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. The bolt can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.">
