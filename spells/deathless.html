This spell doesn’t prevent death from sources other than hit point damage—such as Constitution damage or drain, death effects, or energy drain. Spells that cure hit points affect the creature normally.

If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you become an anchor for the souls of you and your cohorts. The range increases to 30 feet, and instead of affecting one creature, it affects all allies within a 30-footradius emanation centered on you.  
  
**Augmented (8th)**: If you expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, and the area to a 1-mileradius emanation centered on you.">
