  <meta name="Description" content="A _sleep_ spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). _Sleep_ does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

The spell affects up to 8 Hit Dice of creatures, and you can choose the order in which creatures are affected by the spell. Any effect that would automatically awaken a sleeping creature instead allows it to attempt a new Will saving throw to awaken.  
  
**Augmented (8th)**: If you expend three uses of mythic power, you can target all living creatures other than you that have 8 Hit Dice or fewer in a 1-mile radius centered on you. Creatures that fail their saving throws fall asleep for a number of days equal to your tier. You can select a number of creatures up to your tier to not be affected by the spell.">
