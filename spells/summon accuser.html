  <meta name="Description" content="This spell summons a single accuser devil from Hell to do the spellcaster’s bidding, similar to how _summon monster_ spells function. Accuser devils, known to diabolists as zebubs, are hideous flying creatures with the torso of a plump human infant and the body and wings of an enormous fly. They make excellent spies, for they have the ability to grant visions of what they have witnessed to others—the Queen’s Hands sometimes use summoned zebubs to observe suspects from afar. Accuser devils are detailed on page 84 of the _Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_.">
