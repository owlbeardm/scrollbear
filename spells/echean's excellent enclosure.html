  <meta name="Description" content="You call into being around you an invisible barrier of force within which magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed and creatures are affected as by [_antimagic field_](/spells/antimagic-field).

Spells cannot be cast within, into, or out of the enclosure, and teleportation effects that ignore a [_wall of force_](/spells/wall-of-force) (such as [_dimension door_](/spells/dimension-door) or [_teleport_](/spells/teleport)) are thwarted by the enclosure’s field of antimagic.

  You call into being around you an invisible barrier of force within which magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed and creatures are affected as by [_antimagic field_](/spells/antimagic-field). An immobile sphere of impenetrable force surrounds the field, equivalent in all ways to a spherical [_wall of force_](/spells/wall-of-force), including its immunity to [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) and vulnerability to a _sphere of annihilation_ or _rod of cancellation_. The barrier has hardness 40 and 20 hit points per caster level, and can be damaged by both mundane attacks and spells cast from outside the field. If the bubble of force is destroyed, the spell’s duration ends.  
  
Spells cannot be cast within, into, or out of the enclosure, and teleportation effects that ignore a [_wall of force_](/spells/wall-of-force) (such as [_dimension door_](/spells/dimension-door) or [_teleport_](/spells/teleport)) are thwarted by the enclosure’s field of antimagic.  
  
_Echean’s excellent enclosure_ has the same effect on summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead that an [_antimagic field_](/spells/antimagic-field) does, causing them to wink out of existence for the duration of _Echean’s excellent enclosure_ unless their spell resistance, if any, allows them to remain where they are within the field.
