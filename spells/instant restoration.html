This spell can be cast as an immediate action when a summoned creature you control drops to 0 or fewer hit points. Rather than immediately disappear, the creature is healed for 4d8 hp + 1 hit point per caster level (maximum 4d8+10 hit points). If this healing brings your summoned creature’s hit point total to 1 or more hit points, it remains as if its hit points had never dropped to 0 or fewer. Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by _instant restoration_. A summoner can target his eidolon with this spell.">
