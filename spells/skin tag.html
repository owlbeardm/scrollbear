  <meta name="Description" content="You mix a malign spirit into a piece of food, a drink, or some other item to be consumed (including alchemical items, potions, elixirs, or similar items). The _skin tag_ spell discharges when the item is consumed, affecting the creature that used the item unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. The spirit embeds itself somewhere in the affected creature’s skin, forming a painless set of wrinkles and tags of skin that looks vaguely like a face when the haunt activates. You are considered to have a body part from the affected creature for the purpose of [_scrying_](/spells/scrying) and similar divination spells. Once per day as a standard action, you can remotely cause the spirit to make the affected creature’s skin crawl, causing the creature to become sickened for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per 2 caster levels you have (to a maximum of 5 extra rounds at 10th level) unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. Alternatively, once per day you can remotely use a hex, a mind-affecting spell, or a necromancy spell that causes disease or possession on the affected creature. Each time you use the remote sickening or spell or hex effect, the spell’s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.  
  

### Haunt Statistics

**Notice** Perception DC DC 20 (to taste a hint of rot) or DC 25 (if the affected creature is wearing armor or heavy clothing)  
**hp** 5 hp; **Trigger** conditional (using the item or the spell's remote effects; **Reset** none">
