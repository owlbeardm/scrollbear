  <meta name="Description" content="You greatly extend the time it takes for the poison you touch to take effect, giving that poison an onset time up to 1 hour per caster level. (You touch the poison’s container, so you don’t risk exposing yourself to a contact poison.) The target doesn’t attempt a saving throw when initially exposed to the _languid venom_, but instead saves at the end of the poison’s onset time. If the poison is neutralized or otherwise cured prior to the end of its onset time, it is rendered harmless. Failing saves against multiple doses of _languid venom_ have the normal cumulative effect for poisons (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558_).  
  
_Languid venom_ is difficult to detect or identify. [_Detect poison_](/spells/detect-poison) and similar effects detect _languid venom_obscure poison—those effects don’t stack. Use only the caster level check with the higher DC and increase the DC of the check to identify the poison by the higher of the two.  
  
If cast upon a venomous creature, _languid venom_ delays the onset of that creature’s poison when the creature next delivers its natural poison.">
