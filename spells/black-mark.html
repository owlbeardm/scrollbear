The _black mark_ functions as a [_mark of justice_](/spells/mark-of-justice), and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the _black mark_ is active, the target is affected as if subject to _nature’s exile_, but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not.
