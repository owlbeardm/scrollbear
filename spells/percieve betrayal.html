_Ill Will_: Someone dislikes your liege, but isn’t planning to act against her.  
  
_Plotting_: Someone is actively conspiring against your liege.  
  
_Imminent_: Someone is in the process of carrying out a plot against your liege.  
  
Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting or thought-detecting effects cannot have their intent detected by perceive betrayal.">
