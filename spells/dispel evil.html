  <meta name="Description" content="Shimmering, white holy energy surrounds you. This energy has three effects.  
  
First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by evil creatures.  
  
Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the effects with a successful Will save (spell resistance applies). This use discharges and ends the spell.  
  
Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Spells that can't be dispelled by [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) also can't be dispelled by _dispel evil_. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.">
