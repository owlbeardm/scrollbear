If you manifest a portion of the ring in a square that contains a creature, that creature takes damage as if it passed through the ring.  
  
The ring of flames attempts to dispel all ongoing spell effects with the evil descriptor within it, targeting each spell effect once per round as per [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic). Any attempt to cast a spell with the evil descriptor inside the ring of flames is targeted by a [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic) affect that attempts to counterspell the evil spell.">
