  <title>Mask From Divination - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="As part of the action used to cast this spell, you place the mask used as the focus component on the target’s face, after which it adheres tightly to the target for the spell’s duration and cannot be removed by physical force. Despite lacking eyes, this mask does not impair its wearer’s vision in any way. While in effect, this spell functions like [nondetection](/spells/nondetection), except it also foils divination spells that attempt to gather information about the creature, even if they don’t target it specifically. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal the wearer’s presence, such as [see invisibility](/spells/see-invisibility), the spell works, but the wearer is detected only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check. Likewise, [scrying](/spells/scrying) attempts that specifically target the wearer do not work at all unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check. In addition, the DCs of skill checks to learn about the wearer or identify the wearer and its strengths and weaknesses-including Diplomacy checks to gather information, Perception checks opposed by the target’s Disguise checks, and Knowledge checks-increase by 4.

The mask cannot be removed for the duration of the spell, and the fact that the target is wearing the focus mask cannot be hidden in any way from creatures that observe the target.">

  As part of the action used to cast this spell, you place the mask used as the focus component on the target’s face, after which it adheres tightly to the target for the spell’s duration and cannot be removed by physical force. Despite lacking eyes, this mask does not impair its wearer’s vision in any way. While in effect, this spell functions like [nondetection](/spells/nondetection), except it also foils divination spells that attempt to gather information about the creature, even if they don’t target it specifically. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal the wearer’s presence, such as [see invisibility](/spells/see-invisibility), the spell works, but the wearer is detected only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check. Likewise, [scrying](/spells/scrying) attempts that specifically target the wearer do not work at all unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check. In addition, the DCs of skill checks to learn about the wearer or identify the wearer and its strengths and weaknesses-including Diplomacy checks to gather information, Perception checks opposed by the target’s Disguise checks, and Knowledge checks-increase by 4.

The mask cannot be removed for the duration of the spell, and the fact that the target is wearing the focus mask cannot be hidden in any way from creatures that observe the target.
