This grants you the benefits of [_air walk_](/spells/air-walk), except as noted above. Additionally, at any time during the spell’s duration, you can expend the spell’s remaining duration as a swift action in order to gain a fly speed of 120 feet with perfect maneuverability for 1 minute. After this time, the spell ends.">
