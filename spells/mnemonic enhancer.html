_Prepare_: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally.  
  
_Retain_: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the _mnemonic enhancer_. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind.  
  
In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).">
