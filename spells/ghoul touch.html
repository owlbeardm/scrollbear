A paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become sickened (Fortitude negates). A [_neutralize poison_](/spells/neutralize-poison) spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench. This is a poison effect.">
