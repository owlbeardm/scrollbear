  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as [_languid venom_](/spells/languid-venom), but you can stipulate a specific condition or circumstance that will end the poison’s onset time and cause it to take effect. The conditions for triggering the poison can be as general or as detailed as desired, but the triggers must be visual or audible (as per [_magic mouth_](/spells/magic-mouth)) or else based on physical contact with or consumption of a specific object, substance, or creature. This triggering condition can either result in the immediate onset of the poison, or cause the poison to take effect a number of rounds after being triggered no greater than 1 round per caster level. You must make all decisions involving triggering when you cast _contingent venom_, and you can’t change those decisions later.">
