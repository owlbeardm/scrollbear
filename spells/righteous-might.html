If you are an oracle see FAQ

At 15th level, this Damage Reduction becomes 10/evil or 10/good (the maximum). Your size modifier for AC and attacks changes as appropriate to your new size category (see **Table: Size Modifiers**). This spell doesn’t change your speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate to your new size.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process (see Smashing an Object). If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you–the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.

All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons deal more damage (see **Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage**). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.

FAQ

What kind of DR does an oracle get from the righteous might spell?

If the oracle chose the “all cure spells” option for her spells known, treat that as “channels positive energy” for the purpose of righteous might. If she chose “all inflict spells,” treat that as “channels negative energy” for the purpose of righteous might.
