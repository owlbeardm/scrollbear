This does not stack with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to [_mind thrust I_](/spells/mind-thrust-i), _II_, and _III_, and you take half damage from [_mind thrust IV_](/spells/mind-thrust-iv), _V_, and _VI_ (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.">
