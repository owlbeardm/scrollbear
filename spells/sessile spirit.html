  You reach into the target creature and cause that spirits within to become dormant and inactive. If the target is a medium with a spirit inhabiting its body or a spiritualist with a phantom inhabiting its consciousness (or a member of another class using the spirit or phantom class features), a failed save renders that spirit or phantom powerless, suppressing any benefits the spirit or phantom normally provides to its host, including bonus feats and spells known.  
  
If a spirit within the target is a creature using a possession effect, including [_possess object_](/spells/possess-object), [_possession_](/spells/possession), or a ghost’s malevolence, the spell targets the possessing creature rather than the creature it inhabits. On a failed save, the possessing spirit isn’t exorcised from the target but is dazed for the duration of the spell.
