  <title>Detect the Faithful - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="You can detect other worshipers of your deity (mortal worshipers, outsider servants, and so on). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you focus on a particular area or subject.

**1st Round**: Presence or absence of the faithful.

**2nd Round**: Number of individual faithful in the area.

**3rd Round**: The exact location of each worshiper. If a fellow worshiper is outside your line of sight, then you discern his direction but not his exact location.

Each round, you can rotate to detect worshipers in a new area.

The spell can penetrate barriers, but a sheet of lead, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. A creature’s personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether or not it is of the same faith as you—hence heretics and splinter cultists of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. Furthermore, since the spell picks up a creature’s current beliefs and feelings, a creature actively pretending to be a member of the same faith also appears to the spell to be a member. Thus, the spell is still useful in locating potential hidden members of the same faith among the general populace, but on its own, it doesn’t weed out spies.">
