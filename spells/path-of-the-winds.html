  <meta name="Description" content="With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to clear a path ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a windstorm. During the first round of the spell, the winds sweep the designated area clear of anything of Small or smaller size, blowing it outward to the sides of the spell’s effect (50% chance of landing on either side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though all other creatures are subject to the wind’s effects. On the second and all later rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a [wind wall](/spells/wind-wall). If the effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds create a channel up to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid. On your turn as a move action, you can move the effect of this spell, either rotating it at one of its ends up to 45 degrees, or moving it up to 50 feet in line with its current orientation (toward you or away from you).">

  With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to clear a path ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a windstorm. During the first round of the spell, the winds sweep the designated area clear of anything of Small or smaller size, blowing it outward to the sides of the spell’s effect (50% chance of landing on either side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though all other creatures are subject to the wind’s effects. On the second and all later rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a [wind wall](/spells/wind-wall). If the effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds create a channel up to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid.
