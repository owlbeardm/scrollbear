| Order\* | Item |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Shield |
| 2nd | Armor |
| 3rd | Magic helmet, hat, or headband |
| 4th | Item in hand (including weapon, wand, or the like) |

| \* In order of most likely to least likely to be affected. |

This spell functions as [create pit](/spells/create-pit), except that it places a 5-foot deep pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact with the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may be harmed. Refer to **Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks** (also copied here for convenience).

Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition. Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how they became broken) must make a Fortitude Saving Throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed. The walls of the pit are quite slippery and have a Climb DC of 30.">
