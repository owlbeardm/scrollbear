    Sarzari Shadow Memory - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="While casting this spell, you slowly destroy a piece of art bearing your victim’s likeness and beseech Achaekek to grant you access to the knowledge and lore contained within the innermost sanctum of the Crimson Citadel, the Sarzari Library. This endows you with information that could facilitate the target’s assassination by your hands. This information must be chosen from one of the three following categories—back doors, character, or weakness.  
  
“Back doors” informs you of hidden passages and other means of navigation within your target’s home. While inside your target’s home, you gain a +10 insight bonus on Perception checks and gain the constant benefits of detect secret doors and find traps. You automatically see through any illusory walls in the target’s home.  
  
“Character” lets you know of a compromising detail about your target’s personal life, giving you a +10 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks when attempting to gather information about your contracted victim from other people. Your target takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects you generate, and you gain a +4 bonus on caster level checks you attempt to overcome the target's spell resistance.  
  
“Weakness” grants you knowledge of physical vulnerabilities your target has, as well as information about the target’s damage reduction, immunities, and other defensive abilities. If these vulnerabilities and defenses change during the spell’s duration, you immediately know. You automatically confirm all critical threats against the target.  
  
Once your victim is slain or a month has passed (whichever comes first), the information you gained from the spell fades. While you can recall certain elements of these memories, you no longer gain any of the benefits associated with the spell. You can only have one target affected by _Sarzari shadow memory_ at any one time; if you cast this spell a second time while a previous casting is still active, the effects of the new spell replace the effects of the old one.">
