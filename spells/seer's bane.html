Alternatively, if you cast [_bestow curse_](/spells/bestow-curse), [_chaos hammer_](/spells/chaos-hammer), [_contagion_](/spells/contagion), [_holy smite_](/spells/holy-smite), _order’s wrath_, [_poison_](/spells/poison), or [_unholy blight_](/spells/unholy-blight) in the round immediately following _seer’s bane_, you can replace the spell’s damaging effect with the effects of that second spell (the divination’s caster—and potentially those around him—save as normal for the modifying spell).">
