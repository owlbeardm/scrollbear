  <meta name="Description" content="This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force). Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force) first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.

When scribing a _symbol of sealing_, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of sealing_, but doing this extends the casting time as described under [symbol of death](/spells/symbol-of-death) (Core Rulebook 355). However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned—the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.

A [disintegrate](/spells/disintegrate) spell or similar effect can destroy the [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force) created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A [knock](/spells/knock) spell has no effect on a _symbol of sealing_ or its force wall. A _symbol of sealing_ cannot be dispelled, but [mage’s disjunction](/spells/mage_s-disjunction) automatically destroys it.">

  This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force). Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force) first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.

When scribing a _symbol of sealing_, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of sealing_, but doing this extends the casting time as described under [symbol of death](/spells/symbol-of-death) (Core Rulebook 355). However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned—the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.

A [disintegrate](/spells/disintegrate) spell or similar effect can destroy the [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force) created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A [knock](/spells/knock) spell has no effect on a _symbol of sealing_ or its force wall. A _symbol of sealing_ cannot be dispelled, but [mage’s disjunction](/spells/mage_s-disjunction) automatically destroys it.
