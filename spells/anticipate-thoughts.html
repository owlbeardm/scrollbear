  <meta name="Description" content="This spell taps into the target’s mind so you get an impression of the actions it will take. You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC against the target’s attacks. If the target fails its Will save, you also see how the target will react to your attacks, and the bonus applies on your attack rolls and damage rolls against the target. These bonuses apply only while the target is within range of the spell, though if it goes out of range, the bonuses return once it’s back in range. Whenever the target misses you with an attack, the spell’s bonuses increase by 1 until the spell ends (to a maximum of +5).">
