  <meta name="Description" content="You imbue a projectile weapon with the ability to ricochet any projectiles that hit one target so that they also hit another. When the wielder ricochets a projectile, she selects a primary target to attack. If she hits the primary target, the projectile ricochets instead of being destroyed. The wielder can then select a secondary target that is within 20 feet of the primary target. She makes an attack roll against the secondary target at the same base attack bonus, but does not gain the benefit from any enhancement bonuses or magic qualities on the projectile. If the shot comes from a firearm, the ricochet targets normal AC rather than touch AC.  
  
While the spell lasts, the target weapon’s wielder can ricochet one projectile per three caster levels you possess, to a maximum of six at caster level 18th. Once the target weapon’s wielder ricochets that many shots, the spell is discharged. If the weapon’s wielder fails to use all the ricochets before the spell end, those ricochets are wasted.

If the attack hits the secondary target, the wielder can select a tertiary target within 20 feet of the secondary target. This functions like a ricochet off the primary target. The tertiary target must be a different creature than the primary target.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the secondary and tertiary attacks gain the enhancement bonus and magic qualities of the attack against the primary target.">
