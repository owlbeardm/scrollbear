  <title>Snow Shape - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="_In frozen northern lands, where the earth may be hidden beneath heavy drifts of snow, druids have developed a variation of [stone shape](/spells/stone-shape) that other spellcasters have since learned._

You can form a mass of snow into any shape that suits your purpose, as per the spell [stone shape](/spells/stone-shape). While it’s possible to make crude objects with snow shape, most fine details aren’t possible. However, a successful Craft (weapons) check allows you to create a bladed weapon from the snow. The DC of this check is equal to the DC listed with the Craft (weapons) skill. You must be the one to make the Craft check and must do so at the time of casting this spell. A failed check means that the spell is cast normally but the weapon created is malformed and useless. This spell can only be used to craft weapons and not more precise tools or elaborate armors.

Once you create the item with this spell, it solidifies into super-hard ice, gaining a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. This weapon takes double damage from fire. Anyone using an ice weapon takes a –2 penalty on attacks due to the slippery, unwieldy nature of the weapon, but the weapon deals 1 point of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. A weapon created by this spell lasts for 24 hours before melting into uselessness.">
