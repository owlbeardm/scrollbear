The target forgets an additional round, back to the beginning of the turn before its last turn.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend 1 round implanting a false memory in the affected target. This false memory is limited to events that could have occurred during the time it just forgot, as if using [_modify memory_](/spells/modify-memory) but limited to that short period of time. For example, you couldn’t implant the memory of a lengthy conversation, as that couldn’t happen in the forgotten length of time.  
  
The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to the _mythic memory lapse_ DC plus your tier) to resist this implanted memory. Success means no memory is implanted, but the target still forgets the allotted time.">
