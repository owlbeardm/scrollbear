  <meta name="Description" content="This spell allows the target to cause the ground to rise up beneath him. As a swift action, the target can cause the ground to rise 5 feet, while all adjacent squares are treated as steep slopes. The _groundswell_ precludes flanking from creatures standing at lower elevations than the target. If the target moves after creating a _groundswell_, the ground returns to its normal elevation at the end of his turn; otherwise, it remains in place until the target moves or uses a swift action to return the ground to normal. A _groundswell_ cannot increase elevation of the ground beyond 5 feet.">
