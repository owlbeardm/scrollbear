These rays function similarly to the rays from [_scorching ray_](/spells/scorching-ray) (you can fire them at close range, they’re ranged touch attacks, they deal 4d6 points of fire damage each, and spell resistance negates them) except that they work both underwater and above water without a caster level check for being a fire spell.">
