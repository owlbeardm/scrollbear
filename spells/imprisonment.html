  When you cast _imprisonment_ and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the [_temporal stasis_](/spells/temporal-stasis) spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a [_freedom_](/spells/freedom) spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a _crystal ball_, a [_locate object_](/spells/locate-object) spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but [_discern location_](/spells/discern-location) does. A [_wish_](/spells/wish) or [_miracle_](/spells/miracle) spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a –4 penalty on its save.
