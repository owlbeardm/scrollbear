  <meta name="Description" content="Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.  
  
As a standard action as long as this spell’s effects persist, you may direct your _burning gaze_ against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from _burning gaze_.  
  
Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack—foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze.

You may focus your burning gaze on a creature or object as a move action instead of as a standard action. The target takes 1d8 points of fire damage for failing its save and for each round it’s on fire.  
  
**Augmented**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, once during the spell’s duration you can, as a full-round action, direct your burning gaze at up to one creature per caster level.">
