    Geb's Hammer - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="Centuries of war with Nex trained the necromancers of Geb to extract every last resource from the mindless undead that make up most of Geb’s rank-and-file troops.  
  
When you cast this spell, you draw the remains of nearby destroyed undead together and fuse them into a mass of flesh and bone you can then hurl at any foes within range. Three corpses within range of the spell are required for the spell to function. _Geb’s hammer_ can be directed to attack one foe within range per round as a move action. It uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, modified by your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever one is highest). On a hit, the corpse hammer deals 1d6 points of damage per three caster levels (to a maximum of 6d6 points of damage).  
  
_Geb’s hammer_ also has secondary effects based on the nature of the three bodies you use to create it. If the majority used to create _Geb’s hammer_ (at least two) were skeletal, the jagged bits of bone cause the corpse hammer to deal slashing damage and increase _Geb’s hammer’s_ critical threat range to 19–20. On the other hand, if the majority were fleshy (at least two), the increased mass causes _Geb’s hammer_ to deal bludgeoning damage and increase its critical hit damage to ×3.  
  
Undead that have been destroyed by positive energy or a similar effect that does not leave a corpse, like a [_disintegrate_](/spells/disintegrate) spell, cannot be used to form _Geb’s hammer_.">
