Each _mythic vermin shape_ spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic _vermin shape_ spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know a lower-level _mythic vermin shape_ spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn _mythic vermin shape II_ if you know [_vermin shape II_](/spells/vermin-shape-ii), even if you don’t know _mythic vermin shape I_). Each _mythic vermin shape_ spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.  
  
The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0), and the resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects increases by 2. Choose one natural attack type the vermin form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4).  
  
**Augmented (2nd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round a number of times equal to your tier. For example, if you are 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of _mythic vermin shape_.">
