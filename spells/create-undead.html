You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms.

This spell must be cast at night.

1 A huecuva can be created using _create undead_. The caster must be at least 11th level and the spell normally uses the body of an evil cleric. The spell can be used to create a huecuva using the body of a good cleric, but this requires a DC 20 caster level check. Creating a huecuva in this way is considered to be one of the most heinous things that can be done to a cleric that has passed away. The faithless aura of huecuvas created from the bodies of good clerics in this way grants a +4 profane bonus on Will saves to resist channeled energy and any effects based off that ability.

2 The _create undead_ spell can create festrogs as if they were ghasts. The caster must be able to cast [contagion](/spells/contagion), have access to that spell in a scroll or other magic item, or work with another caster who has access to the spell; creating the festrog expends the prepared [contagion](/spells/contagion) spell, uses an appropriate spell slot, or a charge from the magical source. If the corpse to be animated died of necrotic boils (the disease that festrogs spread) the [contagion](/spells/contagion) spell is not necessary.

3 A spellcaster of 14th level or higher can create a blast shadow using _create undead_. In addition to the normal components of the spell, the spellcaster must use the body of a creature that died as a result of a fire spell or effect. The spell must be one that affects an area. [Scorching ray](/spells/scorching-ray) is not sufficient, but [fireball](/spells/fireball) is. The creature must have died within 24 hours of the casting of _create undead_. Blast shadows created in this way are loyal to their creator, but those created by a death burst are beholden to no one.

4 You must have a caster level greater than the HD of the undead to be created.">
