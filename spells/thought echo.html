    Thought Echo - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="When you cast this spell, you establish a mental echo of up to 25 words. Any attempt to read the surface thoughts of the target creature reads only this mental echo unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + your caster level). If you cast _thought echo_ on yourself, the DC is instead equal to 15 + your caster level. In addition, when casting this spell upon yourself, you can change the echoed thoughts by taking a standard action and concentrating.  
  
Each time you change the words echoed by the spell in this way, you reduce the spell’s remaining duration by 1 minute. _Thought echo_ does not interfere with telepathy or mind reading effects that are capable of reaching thoughts deeper than surface thoughts.">
