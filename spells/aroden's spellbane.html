  <meta name="Description" content="One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he became a god, _Aroden’s spellbane_ creates an area within which spells selected by you simply do not function. Select one spell per five caster levels at the time of casting. The spells selected cannot be changed after the spell is cast. _Aroden’s spellbane_ otherwise functions like [_antimagic field_](/spells/antimagic-field), except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells. Only the exact spells mentioned are affected—a _spellbane_ set to prevent the casting of _summon nature’s ally II_ would not prevent castings of _summon nature’s ally I_ or _summon nature’s ally III_. If you move into an area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is in effect, that spell is affected as if by [_antimagic field_](/spells/antimagic-field). If the spell affects a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check against the creature’s spell resistance to make it wink out.  
  
_Aroden’s spellbane_ can even negate an [_antimagic field_](/spells/antimagic-field), another _Aroden’s spellbane_, or any spell that specifies immunity to [_antimagic field_](/spells/antimagic-field) (such as [_wall of force_](/spells/wall-of-force), [_prismatic sphere_](/spells/prismatic-sphere), and [_prismatic wall_](/spells/prismatic-wall)). Multiple _spellbane_ effects can overlap. Their effects stack, preventing the functioning of every spell targeted by any of the multiple _spellbane_ emanations. Spell effects created by artifacts or deities cannot be suppressed by _Aroden’s spellbane_.
