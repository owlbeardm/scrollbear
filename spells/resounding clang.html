To be affected by the spell, an item must be composed primarily of metal. Nonmetallic objects with metal components (such as studded leather armor or padded armor with armor spikes) are not affected. Creatures made of metal take the penalties described above on attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and Reflex saves.">
