For the duration of this extract, any potion or elixir you consume is treated as if it were empowered. Increase all variable numeric effects of the potion or elixir by half.

If the potion or elixir does not have any variable numeric effects, or has an instantaneous duration, _amplify elixir_ has no effect. _Amplify elixir_ affects oils that target you, but it has no effect on oils that target your equipment.">
