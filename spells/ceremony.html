  <meta name="Description" content="You harness divine power to create one of four different ceremonies—a funeral, holiday fete, marriage, or naming—and can also create two domain-based ceremonies. Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell.

If you are using the downtime system you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony.
