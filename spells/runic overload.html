    Runic Overload - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell charges magical runes to an explosive degree. If cast on a creature with magical runes on its body, such as a rune giant or a runescarred creature (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Cities of Golarion_ 60), it deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the target and stuns the target for 1 round. When the spell is cast in this way, it must overcome the target’s spell resistance. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the stun effect.  
  
The spell can also be cast on other magical runes, such as those from [_arcane mark_](/spells/arcane-mark) or [_explosive runes_](/spells/explosive-runes). In this case, the resulting explosion deals 1d8 points of sonic damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8) to all creatures within a 5-foot radius. Creatures in the area that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage. This spell doesn’t destroy runes; targeted runes continue to function normally. Mundane runes, such as ones in writing or runic tattoos, cannot be affected by this spell.">
