    Deivon's Parry - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="Originally designed by an Aldori magus who had long admired swashbucklers for their ability to deflect blows, _Deivon’s parry_ has swiftly gained popularity among bards and magi alike. Your reflexes snap into action, allowing you to deflect a blow. This spell can be cast only when an opponent makes a melee attack against you, and only before the attack roll has been made. Make a parry attempt with a light or one-handed weapon you’re wielding, as if using the swashbuckler’s opportune parry and riposte deed (except that this does not require panache). You cannot riposte as part of this spell’s effect.">
