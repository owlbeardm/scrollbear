    Crushing Hand - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as [_interposing hand_](/spells/interposing-hand), except that it can also grapple one opponent as [_grasping hand_](/spells/grasping-hand). Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A _crushing hand_ deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The _crushing hand_ can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as [_forceful hand_](/spells/forceful-hand)), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as [_interposing hand_](/spells/interposing-hand) does.">
