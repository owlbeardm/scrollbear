    Flesh to Ooze - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This functions like [_baleful polymorph_](/spells/baleful-polymorph), except the target becomes an ooze. A creature of 3 HD or less becomes a gray ooze, 4–9 HD becomes a gelatinous cube or ochre jelly, and 10+ HD becomes a black pudding. Alternatively, instead of a creature you may target a quantity of inert flesh (such as that created by the [_stone to flesh_](/spells/stone-to-flesh) spell) of sufficient mass, which becomes an ooze of your choice.  
  
Because a target’s gear does not transform with it, any items fall under or within the ooze’s body, which may mean the items are destroyed. If the ooze has the split ability, splitting the ooze creates one ooze that retains the creature’s original identity (for the purpose of memories or restoring the creature) and one normal mindless ooze of that type.">
