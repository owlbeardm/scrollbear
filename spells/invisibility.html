  <meta name="Description" content="The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.  
  
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.  
  
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as [_bless_](/spells/bless) that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.  
  
_Invisibility_ can be made permanent (on objects only) with a [_permanency_](/spells/permanency) spell.

The invisible target can’t be detected with [_detect magic_](/spells/detect-magic) or other spells that detect magic auras. The invisibility can’t be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as [_see invisibility_](/spells/see-invisibility) or [_glitterdust_](/spells/glitterdust)), though [_true seeing_](/spells/true-seeing) and _dust of appearance_ can reveal the invisible target’s presence.  
  
**Augmented (3rd)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the invisible target is undetectable by blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense.">
