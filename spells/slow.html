  <meta name="Description" content="An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A _slowed_ creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.  
  
Multiple _slow_ effects don't stack. _Slow_ counters and dispels [_haste_](/spells/haste).

The penalty on attack rolls, on Reflex saves, and to AC increases to –2, and affected creatures move at one-fourth speed. Select one affected creature; this creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.">
