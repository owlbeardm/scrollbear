  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like the spell glyph version (see box at right) of [glyph of warding](/spells/glyph-of-warding), except you can store a hex you know (but not a major hex or a grand hex) instead of a spell. If the hex has a target, it targets the intruder. If the hex has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. The triggered hex uses this spell’s caster level and DC.

Spell Glyphs

You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph.

[Read magic](/spells/read-magic) allows its caster to identify a hex glyph with a successful DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and indicates that it stores a hex, but does not indicate the effect of that hex.">

If the hex has a target, it targets the intruder. If the hex has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. The triggered hex uses this spell’s caster level and DC.

[Read magic](/spells/read-magic) allows its caster to identify a hex glyph with a successful DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and indicates that it stores a hex, but does not indicate the effect of that hex.
