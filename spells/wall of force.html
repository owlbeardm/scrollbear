A _wall of force_ can be damaged by spells as normal, except for [_disintegrate_](/spells/disintegrate), which automatically destroys it. It can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but a _wall of force_ has hardness 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level.

Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through a _wall of force_ in either direction, although [_dimension door_](/spells/dimension-door), [_teleport_](/spells/teleport), and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent the wall by going around it, through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a _wall of force_.  
  
The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.  
  
_Wall of force_ can be made permanent with a [_permanency_](/spells/permanency) spell.

A nonmythic [_disintegrate_](/spells/disintegrate) spell or _rod of cancellation_ negates a 10-foot-square section of a _mythic wall of force_ for 1 round, after which the wall reforms at full strength. One side of the wall (chosen by you) repels creatures within 5 feet as a [_repulsion_](/spells/repulsion) spell (using the DC _wall of force_ would have if it allowed a saving throw).">
