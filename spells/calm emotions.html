    Calm Emotions - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but _calm emotions_ can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.  
  
This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as [_bless_](/spells/bless), [_good hope_](/spells/good-hope), and [_rage_](/spells/rage), and also negates a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the _confused_ condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell, condition, or effect has no effect. When the _calm emotions_ spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.">
