  <meta name="Description" content="_Hallow_ makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects.  
  
First, the site is warded by a [_magic circle against evil_](/spells/magic-circle-against-evil) effect.  
  
Second, the DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist negative energy is reduced by 4. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.  
  
Third, any dead body interred in a _hallowed_ site cannot be turned into an undead creature.  
  
Finally, you can fix a single spell effect to the _hallowed_ site. The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting _hallow_ again.  
  
Spell effects that may be tied to a _hallowed_ site include [_aid_](/spells/aid), [_bane_](/spells/bane), [_bless_](/spells/bless), [_cause fear_](/spells/cause-fear), [_darkness_](/spells/darkness), [_daylight_](/spells/daylight), [_death ward_](/spells/death-ward), [_deeper darkness_](/spells/deeper-darkness), [_detect evil_](/spells/detect-evil), [_detect magic_](/spells/detect-magic), [_dimensional anchor_](/spells/dimensional-anchor), [_discern lies_](/spells/discern-lies), [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), [_endure elements_](/spells/endure-elements), [_freedom of movement_](/spells/freedom-of-movement), [_invisibility purge_](/spells/invisibility-purge), [_protection from energy_](/spells/protection-from-energy), [_remove fear_](/spells/remove-fear), [_resist energy_](/spells/resist-energy), [_silence_](/spells/silence), [_tongues_](/spells/tongues), and [_zone of truth_](/spells/zone-of-truth). Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)
