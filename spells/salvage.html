  <meta name="Description" content="An invisible force pulls together the remains of a shipwreck. Bits of hull, tattered sails, broken masts, and smashed figureheads knit themselves back together. Rotten wood turns solid once more, and sails re-weave themselves as the rigging snakes across the masts.

It takes a variable amount of time for the ship to rebuild itself, depending on its size.

| Size | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Raft | 1 minute |
| Rowboat | 1 minute |
| Keelboat | 10 minutes |
| Longship | 1 hour |
| Sailing ship | 2 hours |
| Warship | 3 hours |
| Galleon | 4 hours |

At the end of the duration, an air bubble forms around the repaired ship. If submerged, the ship shoots to the surface, erupting with a great splash before settling on the water.

Though the spell requires time to repair the ship, its effects are instantaneous. A salvaged ship cannot be dispelled to return it to a shipwreck. However, before the spell’s duration ends and while the ship is still being repaired, _salvage_ can be dispelled to interrupt the repair process. The ship remains in the condition it was in when the spell was interrupted until a new _salvage_ spell is cast (but continues to age normally and suffers the effects of its environments). A new _salvage_ spell’s duration is modified by any repairs already begun.">

  An invisible force pulls together the remains of a shipwreck. Bits of hull, tattered sails, broken masts, and smashed figureheads knit themselves back together. Rotten wood turns solid once more, and sails re-weave themselves as the rigging snakes across the masts.

It takes a variable amount of time for the ship to rebuild itself, depending on its size.

| Size | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Raft | 1 minute |
| Rowboat | 1 minute |
| Keelboat | 10 minutes |
| Longship | 1 hour |
| Sailing ship | 2 hours |
| Warship | 3 hours |
| Galleon | 4 hours |

At the end of the duration, an air bubble forms around the repaired ship. If submerged, the ship shoots to the surface, erupting with a great splash before settling on the water.

Though the spell requires time to repair the ship, its effects are instantaneous. A salvaged ship cannot be dispelled to return it to a shipwreck. However, before the spell’s duration ends and while the ship is still being repaired, _salvage_ can be dispelled to interrupt the repair process. The ship remains in the condition it was in when the spell was interrupted until a new _salvage_ spell is cast (but continues to age normally and suffers the effects of its environments). A new _salvage_ spell’s duration is modified by any repairs already begun.
