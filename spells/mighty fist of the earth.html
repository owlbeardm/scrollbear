If the attack is successful, the rock deals bludgeoning damage to the target as if you had hit the target with your unarmed strike. If you have a _ki_ pool, as long as you have at least 1 point in your _ki_ pool, the rock counts as a _ki_ strike.  
  
At 4th level, a qinggong monk may select this spell as a _ki_ power costing 1 _ki_ point to activate (if the monk has 0 _ki_ points after activating this _ki_ power, the rock does not count as a _ki_ strike).
