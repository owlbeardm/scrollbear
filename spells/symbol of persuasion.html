    Symbol of Persuasion - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), except that all creatures within the radius of a _symbol of persuasion_ instead become charmed by the caster (as the [_charm monster_](/spells/charm-monster) spell) for 1 hour per caster level.  
  
Unlike [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), _symbol of persuasion_ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of persuasion_ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of persuasion_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol of persuasion_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for _symbol of persuasion_.">
