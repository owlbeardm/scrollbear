  You teleport up to one ally per five caster levels to your location. You determine which allies you want to teleport at the time of casting; these allies have 1 round to decide to allow or refuse your spell, and they teleport immediately upon accepting. Allies are teleported as if you had cast [_teleport_](/spells/teleport) on them (your current location is at least “studied carefully” for this purpose), appearing in a puff of brimstone in a space adjacent to you. If you are in combat and your allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon arrival but are not considered flat-footed even though they have not taken any actions. The spell does not function in areas warded against intrusion by evil creatures (such as a [_magic circle against evil_](/spells/magic-circle-against-evil) effect).
