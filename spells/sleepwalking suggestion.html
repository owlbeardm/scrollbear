    Sleepwalking Suggestion - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="You compel the target creature to rise from its sleep as if sleepwalking and perform a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The spell takes effect immediately if the target is already asleep, or as soon as the target falls asleep if it is conscious. You can specify that the creature should wait before taking action when you give your instructions if you so choose. A sleeping creature doesn’t get a save against this spell. The suggested activity must not cause the target to directly harm itself or others, but it doesn’t need to be reasonable. For example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or poison its ally’s rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de grace action against a sleeping ally. Instructions that cause direct harm prompt the target to awaken just prior to performing the action and the target experiences a vague memory of what it was supposed to do.  
  
The target moves at its speed, but isn’t capable of running or moving at a higher rate of speed. It moves in dark conditions as if it had darkvision and can perform most simple and skillbased actions, but it can’t engage in combat, spellcasting, or actions that require significant cognitive awareness (like making complex decisions, solving puzzles, or using complicated magic items). If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking, it must attempt a new saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell ends and the creature awakens. When the target completes the suggested course of activity, or when the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and returns to where it was sleeping and must be awoken normally. It retains no memory of what it did while unconscious (with the only exception described above).  
  
Unlike the _sleepwalkAPG_ spell, attempts to use _sleepwalking suggestion_ on a creature that is unconscious for any reason other than sleep automatically fail. A creature affected by _sleepwalking suggestion_ is unaware it has been programmed to act in its sleep (unless awoken because it was about to cause harm).">
