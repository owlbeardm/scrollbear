  <meta name="Description" content="You cause metal to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a successful Strength check to open, at your option). A vehicle grinds to a halt and ceases to operate. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon imposes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.  
  
You can warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.  
  
Alternatively, you can unwarp metal (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. [_Make whole_](/spells/make-whole), on the other hand, does nothing to repair a warped item.  
  
You can combine multiple consecutive castings of _warp metal_ to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single casting. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.">
