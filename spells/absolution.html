  <meta name="Description" content="You purge impure thoughts from the target’s mind and fill him with exultant relief at the forgiveness of his sins. _Absolution_ ends all charm or compulsion effects affecting the target (including harmless compulsions, such as [_heroism_](/spells/heroism)) as per [_break enchantment_](/spells/break-enchantment). If the target was forced to perform any actions contrary to his alignment, monk vows, paladin oath, or similar code of conduct by that charm or compulsion effect, that action doesn’t cause him to lose access to class abilities, including divine spellcasting.  
  
Unlike an [_atonement_](/spells/atonement) spell, _absolution_ can’t reverse alignment change or the effects of willing transgressions, induce a creature to change its alignment, or restore class abilities lost because of misdeeds performed in the past. _Absolution_ automatically works if the caster and the target share the same alignment or the same patron deity. If they don’t, but their alignments are within one step of each other, _absolution_ has a 5% chance of success per caster level. If neither of these is true, the spell automatically fails.  
  
If using the honor subsystem (_Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 160_), casting absolution also eliminates the honor loss for events and actions committed by the target while he was affected by a charm or compulsion effect that the spell ended.">
