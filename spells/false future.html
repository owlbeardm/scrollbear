    False Future - ScrollBear

Instead of the target’s true actions or experiences, divinations resolve as if the target will experience some different future you describe as you cast _false future_. The target creature can attempt a Will save to avoid the initial effect, and creatures using divinations get a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. This spell doesn’t prevent divinations cast after the duration’s end from determining what the subject actually did during the time you obscured using _false future_.
