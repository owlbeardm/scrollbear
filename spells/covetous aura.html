  <meta name="Description" content="Anytime a harmless (so noted by a spell’s saving throw description) spell of 3rd level or lower is cast within a _covetous aura’s_ area of effect, you may choose to immediately gain the benefit of that spell as if it had also targeted you. The intended target still gains the effect of the spell. You gain the benefits of this duplicated spell only if the caster is in range of the _covetous aura_. Each time a _covetous aura_ duplicates a spell effect, the remaining duration of the _covetous aura_ is reduced by a number of rounds equal to the spell level of the spell effect that is duplicated.

The duration of the covetous aura increases to 1 minute per level or until discharged. You may gain the benefits of spells of 5th level or lower cast within the aura’s area of effect. You can gain the effects of two separate spells, after which the _mythic covetous aura_ ends.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level or until discharged. You may gain the benefits of spells of 7th level or lower cast within the aura’s area of effect. When you gain the benefit of a spell, the original spell is immediately targeted with a [_greater dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic--greater) spell at your caster level. If the dispel check succeeds, the spell ends for any of the original recipients in the area of your _covetous aura_.">
