  <title>Ropeweave - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="You cause the target rope to grow in length and weave itself into one of several forms, each of which can support up to 1,000 pounds, plus 200 pounds per caster level (maximum 3,000 pounds at 10th level). Only one type of construction can be created with each casting of the spell, and the creation remains stationary unless destroyed.

Each 5-foot section of the object created by this spell has a break DC of 23, AC 11, and 1 hit point per caster level (maximum 10 hp), but all sections of the creation are magically supported and need not be anchored to a solid surface or any other portion of the effect. Destroying one part of it does not cause the remainder of the structure to collapse, though each 5-foot section destroyed reduces the maximum weight the creation can support by 200 pounds. During any round in which the rope is overloaded, every remaining section takes 1d4 points of damage.

You can use _ropeweave_ to create any of the following structures:

*   **Rope Bridge**: the rope forms a 5-foot-wide bridge that spans up to 10 feet horizontally per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Creatures can cross the bridge at half speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check or at full speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. The DC assumes a creature is using both hands to assist in navigating the rope bridge; the DC increases by 5 if a creature uses only one hand to steady itself and by 10 if the creature does not use its hands. A failed Acrobatics check results in failure to progress across the rope bridge; creatures that fail by 5 or more fall.
*   **Rope Hammock**: the rope knits itself into a stationary hammock suspended in midair. The hammock can be suspended at a height of 5 feet plus 5 feet per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 30 feet), with a rope ladder (see below) leading up to a platform of 1 5-foot square per caster level, and at least one such square must be adjacent to the square containing the vertical rope ladder. As a move action, the caster can command the rope ladder to withdraw into the hammock. When the ladder is withdrawn, the rope hammock blends in with its surroundings and muffles sounds and smells from creatures resting on it that are taking no violent actions; noticing the rope hammock requires a successful DC 20 Perception check or Survival check, even for creatures with scent. This does not apply if the creatures in the hammock attack or move more than half speed. The hammock provides a +2 cover bonus to AC against attacks from beneath it.
*   **Rope Ladder**: the rope knots itself and hangs suspended in midair, perpendicular to the ground, stretching up to 10 feet vertically per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Climbing the rope ladder requires a successful DC 5 Climb check, or DC 0 if there is a wall adjacent to it you can brace it against.
*   **Trip Line**: the rope stretches into a tangled mass that fills one 5-foot square per caster level you have (maximum 10 squares), all of which must be contiguous (including diagonally). Any creature entering a square with this trip line must succeed at an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 if moving at half speed, DC = 15 if moving at full speed, and DC = 20 if running or charging). On a failed check, the creature’s movement stops when it enters the square; a creature that fails by 5 or more falls prone. A creature larger than Medium gains a +2 bonus on its Acrobatics check for every size category larger than Medium it is.">

  You cause the target rope to grow in length and weave itself into one of several forms, each of which can support up to 1,000 pounds, plus 200 pounds per caster level (maximum 3,000 pounds at 10th level). Only one type of construction can be created with each casting of the spell, and the creation remains stationary unless destroyed.

Each 5-foot section of the object created by this spell has a break DC of 23, AC 11, and 1 hit point per caster level (maximum 10 hp), but all sections of the creation are magically supported and need not be anchored to a solid surface or any other portion of the effect. Destroying one part of it does not cause the remainder of the structure to collapse, though each 5-foot section destroyed reduces the maximum weight the creation can support by 200 pounds. During any round in which the rope is overloaded, every remaining section takes 1d4 points of damage.

You can use _ropeweave_ to create any of the following structures:

*   **Rope Bridge**: the rope forms a 5-foot-wide bridge that spans up to 10 feet horizontally per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Creatures can cross the bridge at half speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check or at full speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. The DC assumes a creature is using both hands to assist in navigating the rope bridge; the DC increases by 5 if a creature uses only one hand to steady itself and by 10 if the creature does not use its hands. A failed Acrobatics check results in failure to progress across the rope bridge; creatures that fail by 5 or more fall.
*   **Rope Hammock**: the rope knits itself into a stationary hammock suspended in midair. The hammock can be suspended at a height of 5 feet plus 5 feet per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 30 feet), with a rope ladder (see below) leading up to a platform of 1 5-foot square per caster level, and at least one such square must be adjacent to the square containing the vertical rope ladder. As a move action, the caster can command the rope ladder to withdraw into the hammock. When the ladder is withdrawn, the rope hammock blends in with its surroundings and muffles sounds and smells from creatures resting on it that are taking no violent actions; noticing the rope hammock requires a successful DC 20 Perception check or Survival check, even for creatures with scent. This does not apply if the creatures in the hammock attack or move more than half speed. The hammock provides a +2 cover bonus to AC against attacks from beneath it.
*   **Rope Ladder**: the rope knots itself and hangs suspended in midair, perpendicular to the ground, stretching up to 10 feet vertically per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Climbing the rope ladder requires a successful DC 5 Climb check, or DC 0 if there is a wall adjacent to it you can brace it against.
*   **Trip Line**: the rope stretches into a tangled mass that fills one 5-foot square per caster level you have (maximum 10 squares), all of which must be contiguous (including diagonally). Any creature entering a square with this trip line must succeed at an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 if moving at half speed, DC = 15 if moving at full speed, and DC = 20 if running or charging). On a failed check, the creature’s movement stops when it enters the square; a creature that fails by 5 or more falls prone. A creature larger than Medium gains a +2 bonus on its Acrobatics check for every size category larger than Medium it is.
