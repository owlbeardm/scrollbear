A target who can speak and has at least one free hand and who is aware of the spell and its effects (such as from a Spellcraft check to identify the spell as it is cast) can negate one reroll by spending a move action to utter a brief prayer or good luck charm to appease the spirits of ill fortune.

For the target’s unlucky d20 rolls, it must roll three times and take the lowest result. Spending a move action to utter a prayer or good luck charm allows the target to roll twice instead of three times.  
  
**Augmented (4th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you afflict the target with especially foul luck. Any natural 20 it rolls counts as a natural 1 instead.">
