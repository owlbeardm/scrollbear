  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions as per [_detect thoughts_](/spells/detect-thoughts), except you sense significant desires of creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher, regardless of whether they are conscious or not.  
  
Instead of Intelligence, the second round of concentration reveals each mind’s Charisma score. If the highest Charisma score is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Charisma score), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. Instead of surface thoughts, the third round of concentration reveals the most pressing current desire of any mind in the area (Will negates).  
  
Presenting a creature with an opportunity to fulfill a significant desire grants you a +2 circumstance bonus (or higher, at the GM’s discretion) on Diplomacy checks to influence it.">
