  <meta name="Description" content="You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting _contingency_. The _contingency_ spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast _contingency_.  
  
The spell to be brought into effect by the _contingency_ must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).  
  
The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the _contingency_ immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (_contingency_ and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.  
  
You can use only one _contingency_ spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

#### Mythic Contingency

You can cast this spell on yourself or another willing creature as if the spell had a range of touch. A companion spell placed on another creature must be a spell from you, not from the creature, and affects that creature when triggered. The target can have only one _contingency_ spell upon it at a time unless it also knows _mythic contingency_. The number of companion spells you can have on yourself is equal to 1 + half your tier.  
  
**Augmented (5th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time changes to 1 full round plus the casting time of the companion spell, but the duration of _mythic contingency_ decreases to 1 hour per level or until discharged.">
