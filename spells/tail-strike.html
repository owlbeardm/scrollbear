  <title>Tail Strike - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="You grow a draconic tail (clothing and armor adjust as necessary), or if you already have a tail, it takes on a draconic appearance. If you have a draconic bloodline, the tail matches the appearance of that dragon type; otherwise, it matches the appearance of a dragon type whose alignment matches your own. You gain a tail slam attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if Small, 1d8 if Large) + your Strength modifier. If you already have a tail attack, you instead extend the reach of your tail attack by 5 feet.

If you have a tail sweep attack, this spell increases its radius by 10 feet.

If used as part of a full-attack action, the tail slam is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus –5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage. You can end this spell before its normal duration by uttering a bestial roar as a swift action. When you do, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the roar.

Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship dragon deities add tail strike to their class spell lists as a 4th-level spell.">
