  This spell functions as [_instant summons_](/spells/instant-summons), except it can only summon a construct you control. For constructs such as golems that are immune to magic, the value of the specially inscribed sapphire must be at least 5,000 gp. For other constructs, a 1,000 gp sapphire suffices.  
  
If the construct is no longer under your control or destroyed, the spell fails, but you know roughly where the construct or its remains are located.
