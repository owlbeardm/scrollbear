    Wall of Mist - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="With a whispered incantation, you conjure a stationary vertical wall of misty vapor. The wall is straight, is 1 foot thick, and has a length up to 10 feet per caster level. The wall obscures vision, granting concealment (20% miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall. A creature that shares a square with the wall counts as being on neither side of the wall and neither benefits nor suffers from the concealment.  
  
Alternatively, you can create a wall with increased density, but doing so reduces the maximum length of the wall to 5 feet per caster level.  
  
In addition to granting concealment, this denser wall also hinders movement. Any creature moving into or attempting to pass through the wall must succeed at a DC 15 Strength check or be entangled (and unable to move) until the start of its next turn. A creature that starts its turn in the wall can freely move within it or move out of the wall in either direction.  
  
Only a severe or stronger wind (31+ mph) disperses the wall, and it does so in 1 round.">
