  <meta name="Description" content="You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. All creatures with fewer than 8 HD are compelled to stop and pay attention to you. Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against you must make a Will save to do so. Any creature that fails this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action is enthralled for the duration of the spell (as the [_enthrall_](/spells/enthrall) spell), as long as it is in the spell’s area. It does not try to leave the area on its own. Creatures with 8 HD or more are not affected.  
  
When you speak, all listeners telepathically understand you. You can make up to three _suggestions_ to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the [_mass suggestion_](/spells/suggestion--mass) spell (Will save negates). Only creatures within range at the time of a [_suggestion_](/spells/suggestion) are subject to it.  
  
**Material Component**: An opal worth at least 200 gp.">
