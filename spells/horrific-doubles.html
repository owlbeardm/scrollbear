  <title>Horrific Doubles - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as [mirror image](/spells/mirror-image), except as noted.

Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of [mirror image](/spells/mirror-image)). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock. Both additional effects are mind-affecting fear effects, and spell resistance applies against them.

If your campaign uses the sanity system, a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.">

  You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as [mirror image](/spells/mirror-image), except as noted.

Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of [mirror image](/spells/mirror-image)). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock. Both additional effects are mind-affecting fear effects, and spell resistance applies against them.

If your campaign uses the sanity system, a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.
