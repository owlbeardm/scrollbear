  <meta name="Description" content="You mend the target’s injuries, curing 3d8 hit points + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) as [_cure serious wounds_](/spells/cure-serious-wounds), but leaving its body laced with a subtle toxin that remains inert until you activate it. A target that decides to attempt the Will save and succeeds is healed for half (as [_cure serious wounds_](/spells/cure-serious-wounds)) and negates the toxin. Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round’s damage and end the affliction. If you don’t trigger the poison for 1 hour, the spell ends and leaves the target unharmed.  
  
[_Detect poison_](/spells/detect-poison) reveals an inert _poisonous balm_ only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + your caster level. Attempts to identify _poisonous balm_ with a skill check incorrectly identify it as [_cure serious wounds_](/spells/cure-serious-wounds). A fooled viewer mistakes _poisonous balm’s_ aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous effect.">
