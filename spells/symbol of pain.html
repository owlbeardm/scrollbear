    Symbol of Pain - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), except that each creature within the radius of a _symbol of pain_ instead suffers wracking pains that impose a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.  
  
Unlike [_symbol of death_](/spells/symbol-of-death), _symbol of pain_ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of pain_ simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  
  
_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of pain_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol of pain_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for _symbol of pain_.">
