    Repress Memory - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="This spell allows you to safeguard important knowledge, even from yourself. When casting this spell, you recount one piece of knowledge you possess (up to a maximum of 50 words). This knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches omissions in your memory with indistinct haze. _Repress memory_ protects against [_detect thoughts_](/spells/detect-thoughts), [_discern lies_](/spells/discern-lies), [_zone of truth_](/spells/zone-of-truth), and similar spells, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in your memory, or that your memory has been affected by the spell.  
  
A repressed memory can be restored only by [_break enchantment_](/spells/break-enchantment), [_psychic surgery_](/spells/psychic-surgery), [_limited wish_](/spells/limited-wish), [_miracle_](/spells/miracle), or [_wish_](/spells/wish). If you use this spell to negate the memory of a magical compulsion, it doesn’t remove the compulsion, nor does it remove procedural memories that might affect your skills or class abilities.  
  
At the GM’s discretion, multiple castings of this spell might erase memories of a lengthier event or all memory of a place or individual from your memory.">
