  <meta name="Description" content="You use a Harrow deck to tell a fortune for yourself or someone else. If you cast _harrowing_ on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, “hunting down the pirate king,” or “traveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword”) that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell’s duration.  
  
If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards, as detailed on page 293 of this book. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card’s alignment matches the target creature’s alignment. If the card and target’s alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit’s check. If the card and target’s alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a –1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit’s check.  
  
While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can “spend” at any time to modify that card’s associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a _harrowing_ are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell’s duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed.  
  
A single creature can only be under the effects of one _harrowing_ at a time. If it is subjected to a second harrowing while a previous _harrowing_ is still in effect, the new harrowing automatically fails.

#### Mythic Harrowing

The bonuses and penalties associated with your reading are doubled, resulting in a +4 luck bonus if the card’s and target’s alignment are identical, a –2 penalty if the alignments are opposite, and a +2 luck bonus for any other alignment. You can use each bonus twice—once at this doubled value, the second time at the normal value (+2 or +1). You must use a given card’s doubled bonus before you can use its lower bonus. Once you have used both bonuses, or when the spell’s duration ends, the spell ends and any penalties are removed.  
  
A _mythic harrowing_ cast on the target of a non-mythic _harrowing_ supersedes and negates the _harrowing_ effect. If a creature is subjected to a second _mythic harrowing_ while a previous _mythic harrowing_ is still in effect, the new _mythic harrowing_ automatically fails.  
  
**Augmented (6th)**: If you expend two uses of mythic power during the reading, you may discard one card of your choice and draw one new card in its place, replacing the effects of the chosen card with the effects of the newly drawn card. You must keep this new card. You can use each bonus twice, both at the doubled values. Once you have used both bonuses, or when the spell’s duration ends, the spell ends and any penalties are removed.">
