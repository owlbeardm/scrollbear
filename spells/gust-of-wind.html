  <title>Gust of Wind - ScrollBear</title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a -4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the force of the wind.

A _Tiny or smaller_ creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.

_Small_ creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind.

_Medium or smaller_ creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check.

_Large or larger_ creatures may move normally within a _gust of wind_ effect.

This spell can’t move a creature beyond the limit of it’s range.

Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a _gust of wind_.

The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.

In addition to the effects noted, a _gust of wind_ can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

_Gust of wind_ can be made permanent with a [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell.">
