  <meta name="Description" content="You cause the target to transform into a plant over time. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to infect the target. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and the spell ends. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires. It can’t recover this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target’s skin might turn green and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target’s skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment.  
  
If the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub. This final transformation is instantaneous, ending _green caress_. The target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn’t occur and the spell ends. Any changes in appearance gradually reverse themselves as the ability damage heals.  
  
[_Break enchantment_](/spells/break-enchantment), [_dispel magic_](/spells/dispel-magic), and [_remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse) can end the spell before the duration expires, but the spell is contagious. If a caster level check attempt to remove _green caress_ fails by 5 or more, the creature who attempted to remove the effect must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as if it had just been targeted with the spell. If the spell’s target attempts to remove the effect from itself and fails, it causes the spell to behave as if affected by [_plant growth_](/spells/plant-growth) (as described below).  
  
[_Polymorph any object_](/spells/polymorph-any-object) ends the spell and totally restores the target without any risk to the caster, even after the target has been finally transformed, as do [_limited wish_](/spells/limited-wish), [_miracle_](/spells/miracle), and [_wish_](/spells/wish) (treat [_polymorph any object_](/spells/polymorph-any-object) as if it had an instantaneous duration if it is used in this way). If the target is in the area of a [_plant growth_](/spells/plant-growth) spell as it is cast, it must attempt a Fortitude save at _green caress’s_ DC or immediately take another 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score; this stacks with multiple castings of [_plant growth_](/spells/plant-growth). If the target is in the area of [_diminish plants_](/spells/diminish-plants) as it is cast, it ignores the next ability damage from _green caress_ to one of its three physical ability scores (chosen randomly); this doesn’t stack with multiple castings of [_diminish plants_](/spells/diminish-plants).">
