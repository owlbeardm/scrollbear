    Solid Fog - ScrollBear

  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions like [_fog cloud_](/spells/fog-cloud), but in addition to obscuring sight, the _solid fog_ is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a solid fog move at half their normal speed and take a –2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into _solid fog_ is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in _solid fog_. _Solid fog_, and effects that work like _solid fog_, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.  
  
Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.  
  
_Solid fog_ can be made permanent with a [_permanency_](/spells/permanency) spell. A permanent _solid fog_ dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

The penalty on melee attack and damage rolls increases to –4. The cloud’s radius and height both increase to 50 feet.
