**Type** regional curse; **Area** 2-mile-radius emanation; **Save** Will DC 23 to remove  
  
**Effect** The weather in the cursed region changes drastically, even bringing snow to a blazing desert. The area is plagued by your choice of cold weather conditions (Core Rulebook 442), very hot conditions (Core Rulebook 444), or frequent powerful storms (Core Rulebook 438). The weather remains unpredictable, and can change over time (as determined by the GM), but the baseline weather is altered as long as the curse remains.  
  
**Cure** The cursed weather can be returned to normal only by casting [_remove curse_](/spells/remove-curse) at the center of the affected area, followed by a casting of [_control weather_](/spells/control-weather).">
