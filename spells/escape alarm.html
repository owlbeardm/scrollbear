Instead, when you place an _escape alarm_, you can attune up to one additional creature per caster level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to your own _escape alarm_ and don’t count against the limit. Attuned creatures can enter and exit the spell’s area without triggering the alarm. If you select a mental alarm rather than an audible one, all attuned creatures receive the mental alert when someone exits the warded area.">
