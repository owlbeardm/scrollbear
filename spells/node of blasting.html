  <meta name="Description" content="You imbue an object with psychic energy. The _node of blasting_ unleashes a mental blast when a creature with a mind touches the object, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the creature touching the object and causing the creature to be staggered for 1 minute. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered condition.  
  
Magic traps such as _node of blasting_ are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to thwart _node of blasting_. The DCs to find a _node of blasting_ using Perception and to disable it using Disable Device are both equal to 25 + the spell’s level. Additionally, a creature with the read aura occult skill unlock (see page 197) can attempt the same Perception check to notice a _node of blasting_.">
