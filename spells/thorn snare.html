    Thorn Snare - ScrollBear
  </title>
  <meta name="Description" content="This spell functions just like the spell snare but those caught in it take 1 point of damage per round, as the thorn-covered vine slowly cuts into them. In addition, any attempt to escape or destroy the snare deals 1d6 points of damage to the trapped creature.  
  
A _thorn snare_ can only be found with a DC 24 Search check. A trapped creature can escape by making a DC 24 Escape Artist check or a DC 24 Strength check as a full-round action.  
  
_Material Component_: A length of blood-thorn rose vine.">
