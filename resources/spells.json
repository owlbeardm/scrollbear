When walking on air, you ignore difficult terrain that is less than 1 foot high, you do not trigger effects based on weight (such as a pressure plate), and any creature trying to track you through areas you crossed with this spell takes a –10 penalty on its Perception or Survival check to do so. However, because of the instability of the air you walk on, your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and you take a –4 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Ride checks.\n\nIf you have 1 rank in Fly, your speed is not reduced when using this spell, and you can cross over liquid at half speed. If you have 5 ranks in Fly, you can cross liquid at full speed and do not take the penalties to your skill checks."

The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to half the air walker’s normal speed.\n\nA strong wind (21+ miles per hour) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of a creature’s turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.\n\nShould the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an [antimagic field](/spells/antimagic-field).\n\nYou can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of air walk (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with 1 week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check."

This spell has two purposes, and you choose which application to use at the time of casting.\n\n**Combat Corruption**: Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that corruption’s Progression section), it advances to the next corruption stage—at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this spell can lower the target’s corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn’t at progression stage of 1 or higher.\n\n**Remove Corruption**: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of alleviate corruption doesn’t reduce the target’s corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.\n\nEither application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target’s manifestation level + 3 times the target’s corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).\n\nTampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it. Casting alleviate corruption on yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it).\n\nA creature can be the beneficiary of this spell only once per week, whether it succeeds or not."

A typical placid river travels at a rate of up to 2 mph (no effect on local movement); a swift river travels 2–4 mph, moving creatures and objects 10 to 40 feet downstream per round; and an area of river rapids travels 7–10 mph, moving creatures and objects 60 to 90 feet downstream per round. Altering the speed of the current alters the difficulty of swimming in the water accordingly.\n\n**Divert River**: The river diverts its course in a direction of your choosing. The river flows in the general direction indicated, but otherwise conforms to the shape of the local terrain. This spell cannot cause a river to flow uphill, though the river surges over its natural banks and inundates terrain lower than its average depth. Creatures in the path of the redirected river are in danger of being swept away; if directed properly, this spell causes a flood. See Aquatic Terrain for more details.\n\nAlter river can be made permanent with a [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell.\n\nClever application of spells such as [move earth](/spells/move-earth) can be combined with this spell to likewise make the river’s new course permanent."

In this case, the GM provides you with some specific information to assist you in overcoming your problem.\n\nFor example, a character might encounter a clay golem deep underground, and finds that her magic weapon and spells seem to be useless against the creature.

In addition, the target animal is temporarily awakened to sentience (as the [awaken](/spells/awaken) spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its message. The awakened target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, or Sense Motive. It treats any of these skills that are class skills for you as class skills. The number of ranks you imbue in any of these skills can’t exceed the target animal’s Hit Dice nor the number of ranks you possess in that skill.\n\nThe message you send with your animal ambassador can be a verbal message, which the awakened target animal can speak using its own voice or deliver using your voice. It can engage in conversation using its own intellect, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. The animal ambassador is loyal to you, but it is otherwise susceptible to mind-affecting effects like any other creature. You can also send your animal ambassador with an object or container that is within its physical ability to carry, making it deliver the contents to the target of your intended message. If the object it is given to carry is poisonous, trapped, or otherwise inherently dangerous (even if it would normally be dangerous only to the creature receiving it rather than the animal), or if you or your allies attack the target animal, the animal ambassador spell fails and the animal becomes hostile toward you. The animal ambassador intelligently but singlemindedly attempts to deliver the message to its intended target, and you can’t task it with other tasks like fighting, scouting, searching for traps, and so on. It leaves on its delivery once it receives its message.\n\nOnce the animal ambassador has located its target and delivered its message (and object, if desired), its enhanced mental abilities fade within 2d6 minutes. The spell then ends, even if its duration hasn’t elapsed."

They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed skeleton or zombie can’t be animated again.\n\nRegardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can’t create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of _animate dead_. The [desecrate](/spells/desecrate) spell doubles this limit.\n\nThe undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Undead you control through the Command Undead feat do not count toward this limit.\n\n_Skeletons_: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.\n\n_Zombies_: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a physical anatomy. **Editor’s Note**: The rule regarding costing double HD for creating variant bloody skeleton and burning skeleton variants was not included in the fast zombie and plague zombie variant zombie template details. It is left to the GMs discretion if that rule would apply to creating variant zombies.\n\nEditor’s Note\n\nThe bloody skeleton and burning skeleton variants are created by use of the [animate dead](/spells/animate-dead) spell but count as double their normal HD when doing so.\n\n**Note**: This spell can be used on any mostly intact dead vermin that has an exoskeleton. When this is done the creature gains the exoskeleton template. The template does not indicate any additional costs or requirements (see Exoskeleton template.) **Source**: AP91"

You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.\n\nThe rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it – it does not snake outward – so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hemp rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell’s level to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.\n\nThe rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.\n\nThe spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature."

Time spent within an _antimagic field_ counts against the suppressed spell’s duration.\n\nSummoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an _antimagic field_. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast _antimagic field_ in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature’s spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an _antimagic field_ because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)\n\nA normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsider are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures’ spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field. [Dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic) does not remove the field.\n\nTwo or more _antimagic fields_ sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force), [prismatic sphere](/spells/prismatic-sphere), and [prismatic wall](/spells/prismatic-wall), remain unaffected by _antimagic field_. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\n\nShould a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field."

Note that cybernetic equipment does not function in an antitech field, and all benefits granted by such gear are suppressed.\n\nNon-technological creatures can enter the area, as can low-tech missiles like sling stones and arrows. High-tech missiles such as bullets and missiles immediately halt upon contacting the field, and either drop to the ground harmlessly or detonate. An antitech field doesn’t stop rays created by magical sources, but does stop rays fired from beam weapons such as lasers.

There are two ways to use the spell: [sending](/spells/sending) allows you to immediately send an object held in your hands to a nearby location, while receiving permits you to cast the spell ahead of time on an object and summon it to your location at a later time.\n\n**Sending**: If you choose to send the object elsewhere, the spell functions like [teleport object](/spells/teleport-object), except the size of the object is limited and the distance it can travel is equal to only 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels. You can’t transport an object to the Ethereal Plane. You can send the held object to any square within range, and you don’t need line of sight to the target location. You can place the object in the open or inside a container, a pocket, or even someone’s hand. If there isn’t room in the space you select (either because the space chosen is too small or because there is already something else there), or if the person doesn’t want or isn’t expecting the object in his hands, it appears on the ground within the target’s square instead. You can transport the object to an elevation above the floor as long as the destination is within the spell’s total distance limit.\n\n**Receiving**: You can prepare an object ahead of time to apport it to yourself by casting the spell upon it and assigning a mental trigger to complete the spell. You don’t need line of sight to the object to apport it to you, but the object must be within a distance equal to 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels. Completing the spell is a swift action that has the same restrictions as a thought spell component. You can apport an object in this way even if someone holding the object is unwilling to let you take it. Once you apport the object, the spell ends.\n\nYou can’t send or receive an object into a space that is protected by an [antimagic field](/spells/antimagic-field), [globe of invulnerability](/spells/globe-of-invulnerability), or similar effect that keeps magical effects out; if you attempt to do so, the spell is lost."

The pocket becomes nonmagical, spilling all of its contents onto the ground unharmed, if it leaves your possession or you create a new _arcane pocket_."

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.\n\nYou project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.\n\nWhile you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.\n\nYou and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic) cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).\n\nWhen this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear, vanishes."

If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god’s intercession.\n\n_Redemption or Temptation_: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.\n\nThough the spell description refers to evil acts, _atonement_ can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question.\n\n**Note**: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of _atonement_ offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively."

A cleric who gets the “nothing” result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful _augury._\n\nThe _augury_ can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All _auguries_ cast by the same person about the same topic use the same die result as the first casting."

You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.

An awakened plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human’s.\n\nAn awakened animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD.

Do you change its HD to d10s, increase its BAB to that of a magical beast, and gain other features of the magical beast type? It also gains two Hit Dice; are these d8s or d10s? If the animal was trained to wear barding, does it retain this ability once it is awakened? If the animal wasn’t trained to wear barding, how can the awakened creature learn how to wear armor?\n\nOnly the animal’s type changes to magical beast, it doesn’t gain all the mathematical benefits for this type change (think of it as a “quick rules” version of adding a template to a creature).\n\nThe 2 HD it gains are d8s.\n\nAn animal trained to wear barding can continue to do so without penalty once it is _awakened_. Once it’s _awakened_, it can either spend a feat on armor proficiency or take class levels in a class that grants armor proficiency, just like any intelligent creature.\n\n\\[Source\\]\n\n### Intelligent Animals\n\n**Source**: Animal Archive\n\nOne of the surest ways to complicate the relationship between an adventurer and her animal companion is to cast [awaken](/spells/awaken) on the beast. The moment the spell takes effect, an animal companion ceases to be a class feature, and instead becomes a person—an NPC whose Intelligence has increased by 3d6 (potentially making it as smart as or smarter than the caster), and who has an increased Charisma score and knows at least one spoken language.\n\nAn adventurer considering awakening his animal companion should keep in mind the _awaken_ spell’s potential drawbacks. Most pointedly, awakened animals can no longer serve as companions, and the character must follow the rules for Leadership if he wishes to take the animal as an official cohort. Further, an intelligent animal can be difficult to manage. After awakening, animals are predisposed to be friendly toward whoever cast the spell— in this case, presumably their masters. Yet if an animal was mistreated during its time as a companion, or is treated poorly after its awakening, that friendliness is mixed with a sense of confusion that can last anywhere from a few moments to a few hours as the animal reconciles the abuse with the great gift it’s been given. Since _awaken_ is not a charm or mind-control spell, there’s nothing to prevent awakened animals from resenting mistreatment in the same way a normal person of their intelligence level would, and they’re no more inclined to be automatically servile than anyone else. More than one careless druid has found her awakened animal companion refusing to follow instructions, leaving to pursue its own goals, or even seeking vengeance for its former “enslavement.”\n\nOn the flip side, there are many advantages to awakening an animal companion. If treated well, an awakened animal may become a valuable member of an adventuring party, adding new perspective to problems and fighting alongside its friends. Awakened animals can also make stealthy and reliable snoops (for who guards her words in front of a dog?), teach adventurers about their native environments, act as guides, and provide a valuable surprise weapon against enemies who think them mere brutes. Druids, in particular, may find awakening animal companions appealing—either because they wish to become true friends with their companions, or because they would value the animals‘ skills as allies. A devious druid, upon witnessing an enemy mistreating its companion, may even cast _awaken_ in secret upon the beast, trusting that its natural instincts will make it turn on its oppressor.\n\nAlthough the personalities of awakened animals are as varied as those of adventurers, augmented animals often exhibit traits hearkening back to their species. Similarly, certain types of animals may favor specific classes, battle tactics, or even weapons. The following are examples of some broad animal groups’ commonalities.\n\n**Avians**: Raptors such as eagles, hawks, and owls—as well as more bizarre fliers—tend to develop aloof, detached personalities, while smaller individuals are often more social and high-strung. Awakened avian animals keenly observe the world around them—often understanding it much better than their demure natures might imply— and are adept at inferring others’ desires, motives, and intentions. These intelligent flyers are shrewdly calculating and opportunistic, especially when it comes to ensuring their own survival. Awakened birds can often be found high above a fracas, coldly deciding on the best course of action, and only entering a fray when it’s in their best interest or that of their friends.\n\nIn combat, avian animals enjoy taking opponents by surprise, favoring training as rogues and ninjas, though they may also enjoy a bard’s ability to soar above the fray and inspire with their songs and majestic screeches. In these capacities, the birds often use their winged stealth to their advantage, taking cover in trees and then striking quickly and silently. Awakened avian animals use their natural weapons, but often with a twist—devious awakened flyers have been known to drop smoke shot, chain shot, and even bombs on unsuspecting enemies.\n\n**Land Mammals (Large)**: Relishing their brute size and strength, large mammals—such as bison, lions, and rhinoceroses—tend to divide along predator/prey lines. Herbivores tend to be generally docile but easily spooked or enraged, while predators are aggressive and cunning, constantly seeking social dominance. Whether they’re among cowering villagers or in a raiding party, these animals love to tell stories of their physical prowess, and awakened large animals tend to be the worst kind of braggadocios.\n\nIn combat, most large animals gravitate toward brash, volatile tactics, becoming barbarians or fighters who enjoy wading into battle before thinking. The exceptions are those hunters like the great cats that rely on stealth and tracking, who are just as likely to become rogues or rangers as they are to become barbarians. Some large mammals, however, have been known to become samurai, replacing their natural affinity for recklessness with precision and discipline.\n\nLarge mammals recognize the value in using their natural weapons, and augment those weapons in any way they can. For a rhinoceros, that might mean sharpening its deadly horn, while a lion might tip its claws with poison and a bison might overrun its enemies with spiked chainmail affixed to its chest.\n\n**Land Mammals (Small and Medium)**: Encompassing perhaps the widest variety of species—including creatures like cheetahs, hyenas, ponies, and weasels—Small and\n\nMedium mammals tend to adopt mischievous, resourceful personalities when awakened. Used to living in vast ecosystems full of larger predators, these creatures are accustomed to using any advantage they have, banding together with allies or manipulating others to serve their own designs.\n\nIn battle, these animals tend to be smart and savvy, shrewd at observing situations and determining whether it would be most advantageous to fight or run. Those animals who prefer combat to diplomacy tend to value speed and stealth, thus making barbarians and rogues natural choices, yet the natural curiosity of many smaller animals may also lead them to the study of magic, from wizardry to druidism, which brings their own environments under their control. These creatures tend to be opportunistic, perpetually on the lookout for interesting magic items to help augment their natural abilities.\n\n**Aquatic Animals**: Often as mysterious as the depths in which they live, ocean dwellers are predisposed to developing deep, philosophical personalities when awakened. The reflective natures of animals such as giant squid, whales, and dolphins typically manifest in one of two ways: they either find majesty in nature or adopt a religion. Once awakened, aquatic animals also tend to be the most creative and artistic group of creatures.\n\nOf all awakened creatures, aquatic animals are the most likely to become clerics or paladins—or cult leaders, for that matter. Aquatic animals who eschew religion may instead pursue training as druids or bards, or crave the intellectual stimulation of wizardry. In battle, aquatic animals prefer to rely on the gifts their personal beliefs provide, casting divine spells or weaving intricate battle songs and spells. As a rule, aquatic animals eschew combat and fight only when necessary for survival unless an enemy threatens something the animal holds sacred. Because they so dislike combat, aquatic animals rarely alter their natural weapons.\n\n**Primates**: Perhaps the most human in their perspectives, augmented primates such as monkeys, baboons, and gorillas tend to have a wide range of personalities. Most are highly social and communicative, though this does not always make them great allies as they form intense attachments, manipulate others, and vie for dominance. Perhaps reflecting their impulsive personalities, primates generally pursue whatever paths seem appropriate in any given moment, and are likely to multiclass, training as anything from barbarians, fighters, rangers, and rogues, to exotic callings such as gunslingers and even magi. Those smaller primates used to traveling quickly through trees make great burglars and sailors, while gorillas and chimpanzees make better mercenaries and berserkers, charging into foes with terrifying force. The weapons primates wield also run the gamut. A gorilla might choose an enormous club, a chimpanzee a two-handed sword that lets him take advantage of his tremendous strength, and a monkey a hand crossbow or blunderbuss.\n\n**Reptiles**: From the lizard to the constrictor snake to the ankylosaurus, awakened reptiles tend to be haughty and disdainful toward others. They eschew company whenever possible, preferring instead to be alone with their increasingly complex thoughts. Although their gruff exteriors can be off-putting, once an adventurer has earned an awakened reptile’s friendship, it lasts for a lifetime.\n\nWhen they are forced to pursue a discipline, smaller reptiles favor esoteric orders and studies, perhaps becoming druids, oracles, or even witches, while larger reptiles—such as dinosaurs—are often content to remain savagely effective barbarians. Poisonous creatures might become rogues, ninjas, and assassins, supplementing their own poisons with those of others. Though not necessarily evil, reptiles often retain predatory streaks that can seem cruel to others, and some crave violence and the thrill of the hunt over all. In combat, as in most things, reptiles rarely show anger or passion, instead pursuing their goals with cold, emotionless drive, their expressions nearly impossible for other creatures to read."

        "description": "The spell creates an identical copy of you, along with everything you wear and carry, anywhere you choose within range; you exist in two places at once until the spell ends. You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources.\n\nIf the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you’re carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn’t duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.\n\nYou perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don’t find them disorienting.\n\nWhen you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell, You can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can’t also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn’t take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn’t move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.\n\nThe two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same [fireball](/spells/fireball), you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by [hold person](/spells/hold-person), both would become paralyzed on a failed save.\n\nBoth bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can’t be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don’t count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.\n\nAny magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you’re bilocating. For example, the [hold person](/spells/hold-person) spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds’ worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared.\n\nIf you were under an [eagle’s splendor](/spells/eagle_s-splendor) effect that had 1 minute remaining when you cast bilocation, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.\n\nWhen the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate. If you are carrying artifacts when you do this, they transfer with your consciousness."

        "description": "A _binding_ spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level.\n\nYou may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts [suggestion](/spells/suggestion), your caster level for this casting of _binding_ increases by 1. For each assistant who casts [dominate animal](/spells/dominate-animal), [dominate person](/spells/dominate-person), or [dominate monster](/spells/dominate-monster), your caster level for this casting of _binding_ increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant’s level, provided that the spell’s target is appropriate for a _binding_ spell. Since the assistants’ spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the _binding_ spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants’ spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the _binding_ lasts. All _binding_ spells are dismissible.\n\nRegardless of the version of _binding_ you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don’t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.\n\nIf you cast any of the first three versions of _binding_ (those with limited durations), you may cast additional _binding_ spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell’s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature’s save succeeds, all _binding_ spells it has received are broken.\n\nThe _binding_ spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.\n\n_Chaining_: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an [antipathy](/spells/antipathy) spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of _binding_ is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.\n\n_Slumber_: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of _binding_ is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a [sleep](/spells/sleep) effect.\n\n_Bound Slumber_: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a [sleep](/spells/sleep) effect.\n\n_Hedged Prison_: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.\n\n_Metamorphosis_: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The _binding_ is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\n\n_Minimus Containment_: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The _binding_ is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\n\nYou can’t dispel a _binding_ spell with [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic) or a similar effect, though an [antimagic field](/spells/antimagic-field) or [mage’s disjunction](/spells/mage_s-disjunction) affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by [dismissal](/spells/dismissal), [banishment](/spells/banishment), or a similar effect."

This is a standard action, during which you may make any of the usual grappling actions, but if you choose to pin the opponent, you gain the grappled condition as well.

If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).\n\nIf the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.\n\nAny individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you’re blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).\n\nWhile blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.\n\nYou take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.\n\nWhile blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.\n\nSince you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.\n\nAn ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.\n\nAn ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.\n\nForce effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material."

You cannot create magic items with _blood money_.\n\nFor example, a sorcerer with the spell [stoneskin](/spells/stoneskin) prepared could cast _blood money_ to create the 250 gp worth of diamond dust required by that spell, taking 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of Strength damage in the process.\n\nMaterial components created by _blood money_ transform back into blood at the end of the round if they have not been used as a material component. Spellcasters who do not have blood cannot cast _blood money_, and those who are immune to Strength damage (such as undead spellcasters) cannot use _blood money_ to create valuable material components."

The food appears on ornate serving trays or in exquisite covered tureens, as appropriate to each type of dish. Place settings and serving utensils also appear—enough for each creature that will participate in the feast—along with elegant tablecloths and table linens. The spell doesn’t create furniture, but the feast does adapt to appear on top of existing tables (or similar objects in the environment).\n\nThough the feast and all the finery last only 1 hour, creatures that partake remain nourished and sated for 24 hours. Though you have little control over the fine details of the feast, you can specify what type of dish you want for each course and what sorts of beverages are provided. The feast automatically adjusts depending on the type of spellcaster you are. For instance, a druid casting this spell typically creates a spread of natural berries, whole roasted animals, and sweet (and possibly fermented) nectar for beverages, all on rough-hewn wooden plates with chopsticks instead of silverware and sizable leaves replacing napkins."

When the target weapon hits a living creature, in addition to the normal effects of that hit, the wielder can discharge this spell as a free action to open a gash on the target’s forehead that deals bleed damage equal to half your caster level. At the start of each of the target’s turns, when it takes bleed damage, it also takes a cumulative –1 penalty on all attack rolls. When that penalty reaches –3, the target also treats all targets as having concealment (20% miss chance). When the penalty reaches –5, the target is blinded. Stopping the bleed damage ends the effects this spell imposes on the bleeding creature. A target that is immune to bleed damage is also immune to all this spell’s effects."

If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active. When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, it creates an invisible cubical prison composed of a solid [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force). The prison is as large as the splash area of the bomb that you threw, and traps any creature that is entirely inside the area. Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless any creature within the splash radius is too big to fit inside, in which case the effect automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide means for escape, but the force walls extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Like a [wall of force](/spells/wall-of-force), the cage created by the caging bomb admixture resists [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic), although a mage’s disjunction still functions. The walls of the cage can be damaged by spells as normal, except for [disintegrate](/spells/disintegrate), which automatically destroys the cage. The walls of this cage can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but the cage has a hardness of 20 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per alchemist level. Contact with a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation instantly destroys this cage. When using caging bomb admixture, an alchemist can only have one cage in effect at a time. If the alchemist throws another bomb during the duration of caging bomb admixture, any other cage created by the earlier admixture ends, and a new one is created.

The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within the spell’s duration, you are aware of this fact, but the spell is wasted. Knowledge of the local fauna makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a Knowledge (nature) skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area.\n\nWhen the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet of you and remains nearby for the duration of the spell.\n\nIts starting attitude is indifferent, modified by circumstances and interaction. Other than starting attitude, this spell gives you no special influence or ability to communicate with the called animal, although you may use other spells or abilities to do so.\n\nOnce the spell’s duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with its attitude. Most animals will likely wander off, but a hostile predatory animal may attack, especially if it is hungry or provoked.\n\nDomesticated animals or animals trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars or animal companions, are unaffected by _call animal_."

You may not eat, sleep, or cast any other spells for the duration of this ritual. After the third day of the ritual, you must succeed at a Constitution check on each remaining day of the ritual (DC 10 + 1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hunger. At the end of the ritual, you gain the exhausted condition from lack of sleep.\n\nUpon completion of the ritual, the ground rumbles in a 100-foot radius centered on you. This effect lasts for 1 round. Any creature on the ground in this area that attempts to cast a spell during this round must succeed at a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell.

Unlike with [summon monster](/spells/summon-monster) or similar spells, the caster has no control whatsoever over the called creature. The spawn immediately heads in a random direction or toward an obvious target such as a population center, destroying anything in its path, yourself and your allies included.\n\nAny creature may attempt to control the called godspawn via spells like [dominate monster](/spells/dominate-monster) or [binding](/spells/binding).\n\nHowever, if such an attempt fails, it draws the godspawn’s attention, and the monster immediately tries to destroy the creature that attempted to control it. Because the godspawn are all magical beasts native to the Material Plane, spells such as [banishment](/spells/banishment) or [dismissal](/spells/dismissal) have no effect on the called spawn.\n\n**Mythic**: When casting this spell, you can specify a particular godspawn to call in place of the nameless behemoth spawned by the non-mythic version of this spell. In order to do so, you must expend one use of mythic power plus three additional uses of mythic power per point of Challenge Rating the specified godspawn represents above CR 20.

If this damage kills the target, the spell pulls his organs into a set of 4 canopic jars and seals them; 1d4 rounds later, the corpse revives as an undead with the dune mummy template.\n\nThe mummy is not under your control, but the canopic jars give the bearer certain powers over it. Anyone holding one of the jars can communicate with the mummy as if they share a common language. The bearer gains the benefits of protection from evil and sanctuary, but only against that mummy.\n\nUnsealing or breaking a jar is a standard action, which dissipates its power (and protection) but lets the bearer issue a short command to the mummy, similar to a suggestion spell (Will DC 23 negates). You (and only you) may unseal all 4 jars in a 10-minute ritual to control the mummy with an effect similar to geas (Will DC 23 negates); most casters typically include a restriction that the mummy will not harm them, as unsealing the jars leaves them vulnerable."

You can place these trapped squares anywhere within the spell’s range; they need not be adjacent to each other, and you can create any mix of stalactites and stalagmites you wish. Cave fangs can be detected and disarmed as per a magical trap with successful DC 30 Perception and Disable Device checks. All trapped squares created by a single casting are linked, and they are all disabled if one of them is. If you place the traps in an area that is occupied by a creature, the spell effect is triggered at the completion of the casting.\n\nStalactites: Shards of rock drop from the ceiling, dealing 3d8 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex half) and creating an area of dense rubble that costs 2 squares of movement to enter. Dense rubble adds 5 to the DC of Acrobatics checks and adds 2 to the DCs of Stealth checks. A creature that fails its Reflex save is pinned to the ground under stalactites and rubble, gaining the entangled condition until it can free itself with a successful DC 15 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. One Small or larger creature can automatically clear the rubble by working for 1 minute.\n\nStalagmites: Piercing spires of rock erupt up from the ground, dealing 3d8 points of piercing damage and knocking the creature prone (a creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and avoids being knocked prone). Once the stalagmites appear, they function thereafter as [spike stones](/spells/spike-stones) for 1 minute per caster level and then crumble to dust.\n\nIf cave fangs is cast inside of a cave or cavern, each effect of the spell deals 4d8 points of damage instead of 3d8, and creatures that trigger the cave fangs take a –2 penalty on their saving throws against the spell’s effect."

        "description": "You harness divine power to create one of four different ceremonies—a funeral, holiday fete, marriage, or naming—and can also create two domain-based ceremonies. Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell.\n\nIf you are using the downtime system you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. Augmented boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a creature’s highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has no caster level,; **CL** 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your caster level to do so.\n\n*   **Funeral**: A funeral service must involve a corpse and at least one willing companion or next of kin.

Physical attacks cannot hit or harm the chain of perdition, but [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic), [disintegrate](/spells/disintegrate), a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it normally. The chain’s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric).\n\nThe chain can perform the dirty trick (blind or entangle), drag, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, using your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The chain does not provoke attacks of opportunity for making combat maneuvers. It suffers no penalty or miss chance due to [darkness](/spells/darkness), [invisibility](/spells/invisibility), or other forms of concealment.\n\nAs a move action, you can move the chain up to 30 feet. If the chain goes beyond the spell’s range or out of your sight, it returns to you.\n\nIf a creature that the chain attacks has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the chain performs a successful maneuver against that creature. If the chain is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.\n\nFAQ/Errata\n\nThe following is **NOT** errata, NOR an official FAQ. It is merely a post to the Paizo boards by this spell’s original designer meant to clarify his intent and concept when creating this spell. This information is presented merely to help understand how the designer intended it to work. As usual, how it ACTUALLY works is up to the GM.\n\n“Actually, the basis of this spell is grasping hand, and since that is based upon interposing hand you’re going to see a lot of the same language used from that spell as well.\n\nSo, it is an auto-attacker, like grasping hand; but what the spell doesn’t say (and perhaps it should) is that designating a new target is a move action. The language concerning moving it within the 30-ft. range was added in editorial review.\n\nThe intent is the chain does one of the listed combat maneuvers once per round.\n\n**FYI**: This was ultimately inspired by Marvel’s Ghost Rider, and a little bit of The Christmas Carol (i.e. Jacob Marley). As a force construct, it’s a way to drag around ghosts, shadows, spectres and the like. Of course, it has more applications than just that, but that’s where the name comes from.”\n\n\\[Source\\]"

The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.\n\nWhen the clone is completed, the original’s soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical to the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original.

Platinum coins deal 1d10 points of damage, count as masterwork weapons, and are treated as adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. All coin bullets deal an additional 1 point of damage per 2 caster levels (to a maximum of an extra 10 points of damage at 20th level)."

Each intelligent creature in the spell’s area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell’s duration. Listeners with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation. Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a –4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them. You can’t force beliefs on a target if such beliefs would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs.\n\nIf your campaign uses the sanity system, your sanity score decreases by 2 (and thus your sanity edge decreases by 1) instead of taking Wisdom drain each time you cast this spell. Only greater restoration, miracle, or wish can remove this decrease. A single casting of greater restoration removes one decrease in sanity from casting compelling rant, while a casting of miracle or wish removes them all. Affected targets take sanity damage equal to half your caster level (maximum 10) instead of Wisdom damage. The targets might actually change alignment and beliefs if their loss of sanity afflicts them with an appropriate madness, in which case those effects last even after the spell’s duration has ended."

If the spell was a healing spell, the hit point damage or condition you removed returns immediately, even if the subject has enjoyed subsequent rest or healing. Poisons, diseases, curses, restored ability damage, and negative levels removed by the paired spell return as well.\n\nConditional favor recognizes the spirit of your condition and doesn’t trigger a violation due to unintended consequences or circumstances that the subject could not predict with her current knowledge of the situation. For instance, if the prohibition prevented the subject from laying a finger on royalty, touching a disguised prince would not count as a violation if the subject did not recognize the prince, nor would touching a member of royalty while dominated.\n\nThe subject of the spell intuitively knows beforehand whether an action will cause it to lose the paired spell’s benefit."

This spell can’t contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can’t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar contact entity spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication.\n\nIf there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don’t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn’t call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.\n\nHow creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community.\n\nUsing this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn’s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like [scrying](/spells/scrying), the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.\n\nEach type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on **Table: Contact Entity**. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire. Contacting certain types of creatures makes the spell chaotic, evil, or both, as indicated on the table."

See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or some other one-word answer.\n\nYou must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels.\n\nContact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.\n\n| Plane Contacted | Avoid Int/Cha Decrease | True Answer | Don’t Know | Lie | Random Answer |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Elemental Plane | DC 7/1 week | 01-34 | 35-62 | 63-83 | 84-100 |\n| Positive/Negative Energy Plane | DC 8/1 week | 01-39 | 40-65 | 66-86 | 87-100 |\n| Astral Plane | DC 9/1 week | 01-44 | 45-67 | 68-88 | 89-100 |\n| Outer Plane, demigod | DC 10/2 weeks | 01-49 | 50-70 | 71-91 | 92-100 |\n| Outer Plane, lesser deity | DC 12/3 weeks | 01-60 | 61-75 | 76-95 | 96-100 |\n| Outer Plane, intermediate deity | DC 14/4 weeks | 01-73 | 74-81 | 82-98 | 99-100 |\n| Outer Plane, greater deity | DC 16/5 weeks | 01-88 | 89-90 | 91-99 | 100 |\n\n_Avoid Int/Cha Decrease_: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. You cannot take 10 on this check. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. If a successful contact is made, roll d% to determine the type of answer you gain.\n\n_True Answer_: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly.\n\n_Don’t Know_: The entity tells you that it doesn’t know.\n\n_Lie_: The entity intentionally lies to you.\n\n_Random Answer_: The entity tries to lie but doesn’t know the answer, so it makes one up."

The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water’s depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas.\n\n_Lower Water_: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a [slow](/spells/slow) spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.\n\n_Raise Water_: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the _lower water_ version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.\n\nWith either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change the overall area of effect."

This benefit applies against all attacks and effects, not just attacks by neutral creatures.\n\nSecond, a warded creature gains spell resistance 23 against spells cast by chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures, and spell resistance 27 against spells cast by neutral creatures with no other alignment components.\n\nThird, the spell protects warded creatures from possession and influence by such creatures (otherwise as [protection from evil](/spells/protection-from-evil)).\n\nFinally, if a chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good creature successfully hits a warded creature with a melee attack, the attacker is sickened for 1d6 rounds (Fort negates). If a neutral creature successfully hits a warded creature with a melee attack, the attacker is instead nauseated for 1d6 rounds (Fort negates)."

You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.\n\n_Bountiful_: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.\n\n_Elemental_: Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water- elemental dominant trait.\n\n_Gravity_: By default a demiplane’s gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane’s gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional.\n\n_Seasonal_: The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on).\n\n_Shape_: By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.\n\n_Structure_: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).\n\nYou can make this spell permanent with the [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp.

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The “walls” and “ceiling” of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane’s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane’s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.\n\nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane’s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use [move earth](/spells/move-earth) to create a hill or [wall of stone](/spells/wall-of-stone) to create a barricade.\n\nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as [astral projection](/spells/astral-projection), [etherealness](/spells/etherealness), or [plane shift](/spells/plane-shift). You are considered “very familiar” with your entire demiplane.\n\nAs a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using [limited wish](/spells/limited-wish), mage’s disjunction, [miracle](/spells/miracle), or [wish](/spells/wish) and making a successful dispel check.\n\nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two.\n\nYou can make this spell permanent with the [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting’s area requires its own [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell."

You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can’t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within).\n\nThe mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.\n\nYou designate where both you and your subject appear.\n\nYou don’t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can’t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), You can select it unerringly from among all the creatures.\n\nYou must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it’s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don’t realize they’re in a mindscape.\n\nYou must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.\n\nMore creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the mindscape door spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape, but you’re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time.\n\nOnly this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.\n\nAs is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.\n\nIf you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it’s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn’t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.\n\nThis spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.\n\n_Create mindscape_ can be made permanent with a [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp. You and other creatures aware of a permanent mindscape can come and go using the _mindscape door_ spell."

You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.

In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect.\n\nCreatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal. The pit’s coarse stone walls have a Climb DC of 25.

The faithless aura of huecuvas created from the bodies of good clerics in this way grants a +4 profane bonus on Will saves to resist channeled energy and any effects based off that ability.\n\n2 The _create undead_ spell can create festrogs as if they were ghasts. The caster must be able to cast [contagion](/spells/contagion), have access to that spell in a scroll or other magic item, or work with another caster who has access to the spell; creating the festrog expends the prepared [contagion](/spells/contagion) spell, uses an appropriate spell slot, or a charge from the magical source. If the corpse to be animated died of necrotic boils (the disease that festrogs spread) the [contagion](/spells/contagion) spell is not necessary.\n\n3 A spellcaster of 14th level or higher can create a blast shadow using _create undead_. In addition to the normal components of the spell, the spellcaster must use the body of a creature that died as a result of a fire spell or effect. The spell must be one that affects an area. [Scorching ray](/spells/scorching-ray) is not sufficient, but [fireball](/spells/fireball) is. The creature must have died within 24 hours of the casting of _create undead_. Blast shadows created in this way are loyal to their creator, but those created by a death burst are beholden to no one.\n\n4 You must have a caster level greater than the HD of the undead to be created."

You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet)."

The initial sheet of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ice is hard, strong, and opaque, and is 1 inch thick per caster level. The ice is strong enough to support the weight of a typical horse, making it possible for creatures to cross a body of water.\n\nEach 10-foot square of ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the ice automatically. A section of ice whose hit points drop to 0 is destroyed, leaving an area of ice chunks, slush, and snow that counts as difficult terrain. If a creature tries to break through the ice with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + your caster level.\n\nEach round on your turn, the sheet of ice grows 1 foot in all directions except toward you. This growth is [slow](/spells/slow) enough that any creature in the area has time to move out of the way or step onto the ice. If the growing ice completely covers a creature’s square, the creature must choose whether it moves onto the sheet of ice, is knocked prone on the sheet of ice, or is bull rushed into an adjacent square."

The spell conjures such an object near your hand such that you can retrieve it as you complete the spell.\n\nNo matter what sort of object you picked, it functions as a one-handed improvised weapon appropriate for your size and that deals 1d6 points of damage for a Medium creature (1d4 for Small creatures). The item deals the type of damage you choose (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) when casting the spell, though the object you request must conform to the damage type.\n\nThe spell ends prematurely if the improvised weapon leaves your grasp. The object has no value and can’t be used for other functions other than as an improvised weapon (for instance, this spell doesn’t allow you to conjure an expensive spyglass and sell it or use its other abilities, but you could still use it to beat someone over the head). The conjured object can’t already be a manufactured weapon, even in a location where you might expect to see manufactured weapons. It can be an object that would normally make for an unusual improvised weapon, like a herring at a fish market, and it still deals its full damage."

If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\n\nMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\n\n_Aura Strength_: An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, _detect magic_ indicates the stronger of the two.\n\n| Spell or Object | Aura Power |\n| --- | --- |\n| Faint | Moderate | Strong | Overwhelming |\n| Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th-6th | 7th-9th | 10th+ (deity-level) |\n| Magic item (caster level) | 5th or lower | 6th-11th | 12th-20th | 21st+ (artifact) |\n\n_Lingering Aura_: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If _detect magic_ is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:\n\n| Original Strength | Duration of Lingering Aura |\n| --- | --- |\n| Faint | 1d6 rounds |\n| Moderate | 1d6 minutes |\n| Strong | 1d6x10 minutes |\n| Overwhelming | 1d6 days |\n\nOutsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.\n\n_Detect magic_ can be made permanent with a [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell."

        "description": "This spell functions as _detect magic_, except that you can glean much more information from the magical auras that you find, and those auras can be found after a much greater length of time. You can detect a lingering aura for up to 1 day per caster level you have, regardless of the aura’s original strength.\n\nAdditionally, when you use a standard action to concentrate on this spell, you can also study a creature within the spell’s area and attempt a Spellcraft check in order to determine the last spell that the creature cast by identifying lingering traces that the spell left in the caster’s aura. The DC to identify the spell is equal to 20 + the creature’s caster level.\n\nFinally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it. In order to find these identifiers in a spell’s aura, you must spend 1 round focusing on that spell in particular, and succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcana) check against the caster (or a Knowledge \\[arcana\\] check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level if the caster wants her work to be identified and emphasizes these unique elements rather than obscuring them). Once you learn a caster’s set of identifiers, you can remember them as easily as a face or a voice. You can recognize this signature if you succeed at a Spellcraft check when later identifying a spell to determine whether or not that spell was cast by the same individual. The spell [greater magic aura](/spells/magic-aura) can obfuscate this information, making it seem that someone else cast the spell. _Greater detect magic_ grants a saving throw against [magic aura](/spells/magic-aura) (but not [greater magic aura](/spells/magic-aura))."

If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.\n\n_Aura Strength_: The strength of an undead aura is determined by the HD of the undead creature, as given on the table below.\n\n_Lingering Aura_: An undead aura lingers after its original source is destroyed. If _detect undead_ is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power, as given on the table below.\n\n| HD | Strength | Lingering Aura Duration |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 or lower | Faint | 1d6 rounds |\n| 2-4 | Moderate | 1d6 minutes |\n| 5-10 | Strong | 1d6 x 10 minutes |\n| 11 or higher | Overwhelming | 1d6 days |\n\nEach round, you can turn to detect undead in a new area.

        "description": "You can use _dispel magic_ to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by _dispel magic_. _Dispel magic_ can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the _dispel magic_ can take effect.\n\nYou choose to use _dispel magic_ in one of two ways: a _targeted dispel_ or a _counterspell_.\n\n_Targeted Dispel_: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the _dispel magic_ spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell’s caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\n\nFor example, a 7th-level caster casts _dispel magic_, targeting a creature affected by [stoneskin](/spells/stoneskin) (caster level 12th) and [fly](/spells/fly) (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the [stoneskin](/spells/stoneskin) (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the [fly](/spells/fly) (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the [stoneskin](/spells/stoneskin) would have been dispelled, leaving the [fly](/spells/fly) intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\n\nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a [wall of fire](/spells/wall-of-fire)). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\n\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by [summon monster](/spells/summon-monster)), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\n\nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level (DC = 11 + the item’s caster level). If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\n\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\n\n_Counterspell_: When _dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, _dispel magic_ may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell."

Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren’t inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to harmful emotion and fear effects.\n\nUnlike with _dream travel_, there is no chance the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However, if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you do need to roll, using the false identity entry from _dream travel_.\n\nCreatures that disembark from your vehicle can either enter the dreamscape or exit to the plane where the dreamer’s body lies, arriving within 1 mile of the dreamer’s body. All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The dreamer can’t prevent the dream voyagers from entering its dream, but can attempt a Will save to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.\n\nThe psychic vehicle remains in the dream for the remainder of the spell’s duration, even if it’s unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the dreamer can reenter the dream vessel as a full-round action through an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast dream voyage to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the dream again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell’s duration. If the vessel moves out of a dreamscape, companions left behind can’t return to the vessel by being near the dreamer. If a companion is killed, its body doesn’t return to the dream voyage unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.\n\nIf the dreamer awakens while the dream vessel is still in its dream, it can allow the dream travelers to exit or not (as with _dream travel_). The dream vessel remains intact in the Dimension of Dreams for the spell’s duration even if it’s untethered from a dream. It drifts through dreams when this happens, and you can’t pilot it to another dream (even a dream of the initial dreamer if that creature begins dreaming again). If you dismiss the spell at any time, you and all subjects within the dream vessel return to where you started on the Material Plane.\n\nYou can increase the number of companions you can bring on a dream voyage to 10 creatures per caster level, though to do so you must increase the casting time, maintaining your concentration and touching up to 6 creatures per round as a full-round action. If your concentration is disrupted before you touch all of the targets, the spell is wasted and has no effect. Once you have touched all of your companions, the dream voyage begins; however, its duration is reduced to 1 hour."

In such cases the activation is a free action.\n\nNongood spellcasters can cast this spell, but doing so causes them to be sickened (for spellcasters who are neither good nor evil) or staggered (for spellcasters who are evil) for the spell’s duration."

The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can’t move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an _earthquake_ spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.\n\n_Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel_: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An _earthquake_ cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.\n\n_Cliffs_: _Earthquake_ causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).\n\n_Open Ground_: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Environment for more details).\n\n_Structure_: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).\n\n_River, Lake, or Marsh_: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.\n\n_Pinned Beneath Rubble_: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead."

        "description": "You draw forth a ghostly, animated hand through the ectoplasmic veil to manipulate objects, attack creatures, and deliver touch spells at a distance. The hand remains tethered to you by tendrils of ectoplasm. The ectoplasmic hand and its tether have hardness 10 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. The tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length, ending the spell. The ectoplasmic hand has improved evasion, uses your save bonuses, and has an AC of 24 (+6 natural armor, +8 size). The ectoplasmic hand moves up to 30 feet per round, and on each of your turns you can spend a move action to move it an additional 30 feet. If you spend a swift action, the ectoplasmic hand can make an attack using your base attack bonus, modifying its attack rolls and damage rolls with your spellcasting ability score (the ability score that determines your spell save DCs). It deals 1d6 points of damage with a slam attack, and it can wield any light or one-handed weapon. The ectoplasmic hand threatens and can flank targets.\n\nThe ectoplasmic hand can also perform additional functions.\n\n_Deliver Touch Spell_: The ectoplasmic hand can deliver any spell of 6th level or lower that has a range of touch that you cast. You gain a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll when doing so.\n\n_Manipulate Object_: The ectoplasmic hand can manipulate unattended objects weighing no more than 5 pounds per caster level, moving them up to 20 feet per round in any direction you desire, to the limits of this spell’s range. It can pull levers, open unstuck doors, or knock over objects. If the ectoplasmic hand must attempt a Strength check, it uses your spellcasting ability score as its Strength score. Using the ectoplasmic hand in this way requires you to concentrate and spend any actions you would normally need to use to manipulate the object yourself.\n\n_Combat Maneuver_: You can spend a standard action to command the ectoplasmic hand to perform a bull rush, disarm, drag, steal, or trip combat maneuver against a target creature, using your caster level as its CMB and your spellcasting ability score as its Strength score. The ectoplasmic hand takes no penalties for its size. This action doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity against the ectoplasmic hand.\n\n ![](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257856/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257856&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=KXZRYKU2EBIOL4LF) \n\n![](http://d20pfsrd.opengamingnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/irthttpwwwd20pfs-20amplas2ampo-2ampa-260-2257856-2)\n\nGet this book AND support this site!"

If you hit, the target can attempt a Reflex save. On a successful save, the target is entangled for the duration of the spell and suffers no other effects. If the target fails this saving throw, the tendril is more restrictive, making the target grappled and dealing it 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. Each round when you concentrate to maintain the spell, the snare attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple. As normal when grappling, the snare gains a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents it is already grappling. The snare’s CMB is equal to 6 + your caster level, and its CMD is equal to 16 + your caster level. Since the ectoplasm passes between planes, this spell affects incorporeal and ethereal creatures normally.\n\nYou remain tethered to the target for the duration of the spell. You can shrink or extend the [snare](/spells/snare), but if the distance between you and the target exceeds the spell’s range, the snare disappears. The ectoplasmic tether has hardness 10 and a number of hit points equal to 10 + your caster level + your Constitution modifier, and the tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length. You are not considered to have the grappled condition while tethered to the target. You can perform the move or damage action on a successfully grappled target, moving it up to half your speed or dealing an additional 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage to it on a successful grapple combat maneuver check. You can’t pin your target."

Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.\n\nThe elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.\n\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type."

For example, if you are immune to death effects, you aren’t necessarily immune to energy drain.\n\n\\[Source\\]"

Creatures can halve the splash damage with a Reflex saving throw. The DC of the splash is the same as the DC of the spell.\n*   **Cold**: The ammunition creates an ice sheen within a 20-foot-radius burst around the target of the siege engine’s attack. That sheen lasts 1d6 rounds. Creatures within the ice sheen are entangled. Any creature within the area of the ice sheen at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage.\n*   **Electricity**: Creatures hit by the siege engine attack or within 15 feet of the attack are staggered for 1 round.\n*   **Fire**: Creatures and wood objects within 15 feet of the attack may catch on fire.\n*   **Sonic**: Creatures hit by the attack or within 20 feet of the attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be deafened for one hour. The DC of this effect is the same as the spell DC.\n*   **Force**: No extra effect."

This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception check to notice it.\n\nYou may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own body’s surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any Saving Throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action.\n\nWhen you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance.\n\nPortraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image.\n\nYou may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body.

Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw.\n\nA target with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes.\n\nThe effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing.\n\nIf those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist. The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.\n\nIf any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously enthralled members become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile."

The surrounding atmosphere and all creatures within the selected area at the end of the spell’s casting time are entombed in this vault.\n\nThe magic of the vault maintains the natural light, temperature, and air quality of the area as it originally existed aboveground, but any magical effects that affected these qualities do not have their duration extended. For example, a sunny field would remain brightly lit indefinitely, despite being buried underground, while a [daylight](/spells/daylight) spell would expire at the end of that spell’s duration.\n\nWhen creating the vault, you can leave a tunnel to the surface world (up to 20 feet wide), or you can completely isolate the vault from the outside world. Casting this spell does not destroy or damage anything that may have existed in the ground where you choose to place this vault, but instead pushes it farther down into the earth. Should your vault be dispelled, the entombed area returns to the surface, and anything that may have been displaced by the vault returns to its original place.

        "description": "You curse the target with a disfiguring or painful mutation.\n\nThe target gains one random deformity from **Table: Arcane Malignancies** (below). The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled but can be removed with a [break enchantment](/spells/break-enchantment), [limited wish](/spells/limited-wish), [miracle](/spells/miracle), [remove curse](/spells/remove-curse), or [wish](/spells/wish) spell.\n\nAs changelings sense the awakening of the eerie powers they inherited from their hag progenitors, they are often mortified to discover terrifying and debilitating alterations to their physique. While the call seizes the changelings’ minds around the time their bodies begin maturing, the arcane malignancies that mar their features and extremities have nothing to do with puberty.\n\nNot every changeling develops a malignancy, and when a changeling does develop a malignancy, it is often unrelated to whatever traits her hag mother has. These transformations are more akin to a magical allergy, manifesting in response to the well of arcane energy bubbling away in the changeling’s core.\n\nA changeling character can take an arcane malignancy as a drawback in order to select an additional trait at character creation. Randomly determine the arcane malignancy by rolling a d% and consulting the table below.\n\nTable: Arcane Malignancies\n| d% | Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1–2 | The smallest three toes on each of your feet have fused together. You take a –2 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Perform (dance) checks. |\n| 3–4 | Your incisors grow so long and sharp that you have difficulty eating. Eating takes twice as long. Consuming a potion or other magical foodstuff requires a full-round action. |\n| 5–7 | You have an extra digit on each hand, which hampers your fine motor skills. You take a –2 penalty on Craft, Disable Device, and Sleight of Hand checks. |\n| 8–10 | Your limbs and torso are covered with piscine scales that you must constantly moisten. If more than 1 day passes without you applying at least a gallon of water to them, you take 1d3 points of damage each hour until you do so. |\n| 11–13 | Your skin bears a sizable scarlet mark that flushes and lightens with your moods. You take a –2 penalty on Bluff and Disguise checks. |\n| 14–16 | One of your eyes has grown enlarged and developed a pale, milky film. Daylight seems uncomfortably bright to you. You take a –2 penalty on saving throws against light-based spells and effects, and you are automatically dazzled for 1d6 rounds when exposed to bright light or sunlight. |\n| 17–19 | The soles of your feet are flat, and you tire quickly. You can hustle for only a half hour before becoming fatigued, and every 4 hours spent traveling by foot in a day deals 1 point of Constitution damage. |\n| 20–22 | Your already pallid complexion grows unusually sensitive to the rays of the sun. Exposure to direct sunlight for more than 1 hour at a time makes you sickened for 24 hours. |\n| 23–25 | The tip of your tongue is forked and stiff. You have difficulty making yourself understood. You take a –2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks to fool or persuade others. |\n| 26–28 | The painful and stiff swelling of your joints puts you at a disadvantage in combat. You take a –2 penalty on combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to free yourself when grappled or pinned. |\n| 29–31 | Your ears have stretched to an abnormal size, making you overly sensitive to loud noises. Whenever you are dealt sonic damage, you take 1 additional point of damage, and you are deafened for 1 minute whenever you take damage from any sonic effect. |\n| 32–33 | The pupils of your eyes resemble a cat’s, and beasts cannot abide your presence. You take a –2 penalty on Handle Animal and Ride checks. |\n| 34–35 | You grow velvety-soft fur along your back, arms, and legs that chafes and catches under clothing and armor, increasing the armor check penalty of any armor by 1 and applying a –1 armor check penalty to ordinary clothing. Clothing and armor can be specially fitted for you, eliminating the increased penalty but increasing their price by 50 gp. |\n| 36–37 | You grow an extra row of sharp, crooked teeth. The uneven set of your jaws gives you constant headaches. You take a –2 penalty on concentration checks and saving throws against pain effects. |\n| 38–40 | It is nearly impossible to find armor that fits your concave chest and unusually narrow, sloping shoulders. The armor check penalty of any armor you wear increases by 1, and you take a –1 penalty to AC when wearing medium or heavy armor. |\n| 41–42 | Your throat balloons out like a frog’s, and your voice comes out as an odd croak. You take a –2 penalty on Diplomacy checks and on Perform (act, oratory, and sing) checks. |\n| 43–45 | An oozing sore has developed on your face that refuses to heal and makes you more susceptible to illness. You take a –2 penalty on saving throws against disease. |\n| 46–48 | Your flesh grows bark, and your major joints have become gnarled and knotted like tree limbs, causing you to move slowly and stiffly. You take a –2 penalty on Reflex saves. |\n| 49–51 | Your thin, almost translucent skin is delicate and tears easily. You take 1 point of bleed damage from slashing attacks that deal at least 1 point of damage to you. |\n| 52–54 | A massive patch of multicolored warts covers much of your face. People cannot help but stare, and they always remember you once they’ve seen you. You take a –4 penalty on Disguise checks. |\n| 55–57 | Your unruly hair grows with alarming speed. If you do not spend 1 hour trimming and grooming your hair every 48 hours, it snarls in nearby foliage whenever you are outdoors, imposing a –2 penalty to your Armor Class and on attack rolls and Stealth checks. |\n| 58–60 | Your limbs are thin and frail. You take a –2 penalty to CMD against disarm, grapple, and trip attempts. |\n| 61–63 | Your bones shatter as easily as glass. You take 2 additional points of damage each time you are hit by an attack made with a bludgeoning weapon. |\n| 64–65 | One arm is turning to stone, though you retain limited mobility. You take a –4 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of two hands and on attack rolls when wielding a two-handed weapon or fighting with two weapons. |\n| 66–67 | You develop an allergy to one spell per spell level from the witch spell list (determined by your GM). Casting or being the target of a spell you’re allergic to causes you to break out in a painful rash. This rash deals 1d4 points of damage per spell level, and imposes a penalty on your Charisma equal to the level of the spell. The rash fades after a number of hours equal to the level of the spell. |\n| 68–69 | The joints in your unnaturally long thumbs have fused, and you often fumble objects. When you retrieve a stored item, you have a 10% chance of dropping it. |\n| 70–72 | Your knees bend backward like a bird’s, which makes many athletic movements difficult to master. You take a –2 penalty on Climb and Swim checks, and your running speed is only three times your regular walking speed. |\n| 73–75 | A tenacious patch of fungus has sprouted on your back, weakening your system against toxins. You take a –2 penalty on saves against poison effects. |\n| 76–77 | Your misaligned eyes affect your ability to judge distances. You take a –2 penalty on ranged attack and damage rolls. |\n| 78–80 | When you get flustered, heat builds up in your face until it glows with inner fire. You take a –4 penalty on Diplomacy and Perform checks when in the presence of 5 or more creatures. |\n| 81–83 | Your ears curl up like dried leaves, and you experience difficulty picking up sounds. You take a –2 penalty on hearing-based Perception checks. |\n| 84–86 | Your curving, clawlike fingernails grow so long so quickly that they impede you in dangerous situations. You take a –2 penalty on Escape Artist and Sleight of Hand checks. |\n| 87–89 | One of your legs measures noticeably longer than the other, and you lose your balance easily. You take a –2 penalty to CMD against bull rush and trip attempts. |\n| 90–92 | Your eyes have swollen to mere slits. You take a –2 penalty on sight-based Perception checks. |\n| 93–96 | You develop a shaggy pelt about your neck and shoulders that makes you overheat quickly. You take a –4 penalty on checks and saves to resist environmental heat effects. |\n| 97–98 | You grow a tail that you can’t easily conceal and that thrashes violently at inconvenient moments. You take a –2 penalty on Disguise and Stealth checks. |\n| 99–100 | You grow vestigial gills. While they grant you no ability to breathe in water, they make it harder for you to catch your breath. When you are fatigued, it takes 12 hours of complete rest to recover. When you are exhausted, it takes 2 hours of complete rest to become fatigued. |"

The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\n\nYou can configure the meadow into any shape you desire, to the limit of the spell’s effect. The place is comfortable and temperate. The trees can provide enough food to sustain 4 people per caster level for a day. A staff of near-transparent animal or fey\\-like servants (as many as two per caster level) wait upon all who enter. The servants function as [unseen servant](/spells/unseen-servant) spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the meadow.\n\nSince the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the meadow, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond."

The spell can be cast at any distance. The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. The target gains the same bonuses and penalties on its Will save to resist this spell as the bonuses and penalties that apply to the [scrying](/spells/scrying) spell (including a +5 bonus if the target is on another plane).\n\nThe illusion created by the spell moves with the target, and is not stationary. The image can affect the way the target is perceived, the way the target’s surroundings are perceived, and the way that specific creatures or objects around the target are perceived. For the target, and any other specific creatures or objects you specify, you can cause them to appear as other creatures or objects that you designate, not to appear at all, or to have their appearance unaltered. For the target’s surroundings, you can choose to make the target appear to be somewhere else, either a specific location with which you are familiar, or a generic location conjured from your imagination. You can change the way that the spell affects the appearance of any of these things by concentrating on the spell. You can also cause creatures or objects to appear in the illusion that are not really there, or to make a creature or object seem to act in a way other than it is actually acting. In this case, you must concentrate on the spell, or these aspects of the illusion simply remain static. The spell can provide visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal sensations as needed.\n\nThe illusion applies to only those who observe the target via a divination ([scrying](/spells/scrying)) spell, and has no effect on viewers who are there in person."

Final sacrifice can detonate a summoner‘s eidolon, though an eidolon receives a +4 bonus on its Fortitude save unless the spell is cast by the eidolon‘s own summoner.\n\nIf this spell targets an eidolon, creatures within 20 feet of the eidolon take an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + 1/2 the caster level of the summoner who controlled the eidolon."

Creatures that start their turn within the flame trail or that enter an area of flame take a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10). If a creature moves into an area of the flame trail multiple times in a round, it takes this damage each time it enters the area of the flame trail. Flammable objects in or adjacent to the fire trail catch fire."

It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the _fireball_ may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does."

If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A _flaming sphere_ rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.\n\nThe sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A _flaming sphere_ winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range."

As noted in [animate dead](/spells/animate-dead), you can’t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.\n\nThis spell disguises the zombie’s appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie’s outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie’s normal staggered condition doesn’t apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the flesh puppet as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.\n\nAn ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can’t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.\n\nThe string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible.\n\nA DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won’t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.\n\nWhen this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse.

It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.\n\n### Floating Disk Tricks\n\nPCS:DR\n\nThere are some additional options related to this spell if a character has the Magic Trick feat:\n\nAlthough most spellcasters use floating disks as little more than a means of moving luggage, the shulsagas of the Astral Plane have mastered the ability to ride atop a floating disk. A combination of cultural importance, astral secrets, and constant practice allows shulsagas to push the spell’s magic beyond its normal limits. Masters of the art can perform truly extraordinary maneuvers with proper training. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (floating disk) feat to use the trick.\n\n_Defensive Disk_ (Fly 3 ranks, Shield Proficiency): While riding atop your floating disk with at least one hand free, you can spend a move action to grip the disk by its edge, tilt it, and use it to deflect blows. Until the beginning of your next turn, your floating disk grants you the benefits of the spell [shield](/spells/shield). If you are already under the effects of the shield spell from another source, this effect instead increases the spell’s shield bonus by 1 until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n_Disk Rider_ (Fly 3 ranks): You can ride atop any floating disk you create, so long as it has the capacity to support your weight. This grants you a fly speed of 30 feet (average), but the disk cannot move itself or you more than 5 feet above the ground at any time. If you are on a location within the Astral Plane—the disk can instead fly to any height, and your fly speed while standing on it increases to 40 feet (good). When you cast floating disk, you can step onto the disk in your space as part of the action required to cast the spell.\n\n_Drifting Defense_ (Fly 6 ranks, Mobility, Shield Proficiency): Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you can activate the defensive disk trick as a free action.\n\n_Expanded Disk_ (Fly 3 ranks, Heighten Spell): If you are Large or larger, you can create a larger floating disk capable of supporting your weight and size; however, for each size category you are larger than Medium, you must use a spell slot that is one level higher (for example, a 4th-level spell is required to create a disk capable of supporting a Gargantuan creature). Once created, a disk augmented with this trick will always support the weight of you and your personal gear, even if this combined mass exceeds the disk’s capacity.\n\n_Force Check_ (Fly 3 ranks, Catch Off-Guard or Improved Bull Rush): When you successfully charge and bull rush a creature while riding atop your [floating disk](/spells/floating-disk), you can veer the disk into your target, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage in addition to moving the target. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against any attack of opportunity attempted against you when performing a bull rush in this way.\n\n_Spurn Gravity_ (Fly 6 ranks): While astride your [floating disk](/spells/floating-disk), you can fly higher than 5 feet above the ground. However, you must return to a location 5 feet above a stable surface before the end of your turn or fall. If you take damage from this fall, you fall prone atop your floating disk. As a swift action, you can also reduce the remaining duration of your floating disk to 1 round per level. For the remaining duration of the spell, your fly speed increases to 50 feet and your disk ignores all altitude limitations."

The pulling hook keeps you from falling as part of this movement; therefore you can use it to cross a pit or chasm, or reach a higher or lower elevation. If the line of effect from you to the target passes through an area that is too small to fit your body (such as a portcullis or arrow slit), the hook pulls you to that location and you take damage as if you had fallen the distance from your starting point to that location. If you are restrained, such as being chained to a wall, the hook pulls you to the maximum extent of your restraints but does not break the restraints.\n\nIf your travel to the destination is not blocked, you land on your feet, unharmed by the sudden motion. However, the spell does not guarantee you a safe landing space when you arrive. For example, if your target is flying or on a ledge with no room for you to stand, once the hook pulls you adjacent to the target, you begin to fall.\n\nIf you use this spell with your spell combat class ability, you can make your melee attack from your starting position or your ending position."

You can’t attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.\n\n_Windowless Cell_: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.\n\n### By the way…\n\nThe effects of this spell do not move with a ship unless specifically anchored to the ship. Otherwise, a ship running into the effects makes a ramming maneuver."

A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.\n\nIf the _freezing sphere_ strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of a targeted body of water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.\n\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the _freezing sphere_ bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.\n\n### By the way…\n\nThis spell can be used to attempt to trap a ship in ice by targeting the water around the ship rather than the ship itself. The ship’s speed is reduced to 0 for the duration of the spell unless the pilot of the ship makes a DC 25 sailing check to break free of the ice."

        "description": "Casting a _gate_ spell has two effects.\n\nFirst, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.\n\nSecond, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the _gate_.\n\nThe _gate_ itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster’s choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.\n\nA _gate_ has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the _gate_ from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.\n\n_Planar Travel_: As a mode of planar travel, a _gate_ spell functions much like a [plane shift](/spells/plane-shift) spell, except that the _gate_ opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a _gate_ from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you–anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A _gate_ cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.\n\nYou may hold the _gate_ open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.\n\n_Calling Creatures_: The second effect of the _gate_ spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the _gate_ to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the _gate_, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a _gate_ that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.\n\nIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.\n\nIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the [lesser planar ally](/spells/planar-ally) spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\n\nFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.\n\n_Note_: When you use a calling spell such as _gate_ to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type."

The power and abilities of this vestige correspond directly to the value of the offering, allowing for three distinct effects.\n\n**Corrupted Coin**: Making a sacrifice worth 1,500 gp corrupts the focus into a “lucky” or “unlucky” coin as per the caster’s will for 1 month. Any creature that bears the coin gains a bonus or penalty (decided by the caster at the time of casting) on all Appraise, Bluff, Craft, and Profession checks. This bonus or penalty is equal to 1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). In addition, the coin can produce an effect similar to the spell [augury](/spells/augury) once per day—its ﬂip producing a weal (heads), woe (tails), or nothing result (landing on the edge). Potentially unknown to the bearer (if different from the caster), the caster can telepathically hear any question asked of the coin and, as a free action, influence the result as he chooses.\n\n**Mammon’s Mantle**: Making a sacrifice worth 3,000 gp transforms the coin into a kind of infernal aegis for any who swallow the coin. Upon ingesting the coin, the target gains a bonus to Charisma equal to +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bearer’s blood also takes on a hue like liquid gold and runs slowly, granting him immunity to poison, disease, and aging effects, and causing him to automatically stabilize if reduced to fewer than 0 hit points. Additionally, the bearer can eat gold to heal himself, regaining 1 hit point for every 20 gold pieces he consumes (materials other than gold provide no beneﬁt). The coin’s effects last for 1 day per caster level.\n\n**Gold Guardian**: Making a sacrifice worth 6,000 gp allows the focus coin to animate nearby coins. When cast into a pile of 100,000 coins, an animate hoard forms under the control of the caster. The guardian serves for 1 month. After this month, coins begin disappearing from the guardian at a rate of 100 gp per day, reducing the creature’s hit points by 1 per day. When the guardian’s hit points reach 0, the guardian collapses and the focus coin is destroyed. Coins lost from the guardian can be replaced, restoring any lost hit points.\n\nIn addition to the effects of any of these offerings, should the focus coin be swallowed, any being sired or conceived by the creature while the magic is in effect is born as a tieﬂing (bearing an indirect relation to Mammon himself)."

A successful Saving Throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the _geyser_ (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the _geyser_ but still adjacent to it).\n\nThis movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature’s normal movement.\n\nIn addition, the _geyser_ sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the _geyser_‘s height (e.g., a 50-foot _geyser_ has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them.\n\nYou can choose to make a smaller _geyser_ than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that’s smaller than what would be created by a full-height _geyser_ spell."

Any creature that successfully grapples with it, is grappled by it, or hits it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 1d4 points of piercing damage.

This spell is most commonly used to track bribes and illicit purchases back to their ultimate source.\n\nGilded whispers allows you to use a single coin as a conduit for an eavesdropping spell. When you use a divination ([scrying](/spells/scrying)) spell or item, such as clairvoyance/clairaudience, [scrying](/spells/scrying), or a crystal ball, you can choose to target a coin you have affected with gilded whispers instead of a creature or location (even if you would not otherwise be able to target an object), though any range limits on the [scrying](/spells/scrying) effect still apply. If the coin is held or carried by a creature, its owner receives any applicable saving throw against the effect. The caster of gilded whispers treats the coin as a familiar subject. The residual psychic impressions left upon the coin by other handlers help mask this dweomer from detection, protecting gilded whispers against location by [detect magic](/spells/detect-magic), [arcane sight](/spells/arcane-sight), and similar effects unless the latter spell’s caster succeeds on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast gilded whispers. The scrying sensor created by using a divination ([scrying](/spells/scrying)) spell to observe or listen to the coin’s surroundings can be detected as normal."

The area of the spell is considered difficult terrain. A creature moving through the glue must succeed at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as part of its move action (DC = the spell’s DC). Creatures that fail lose their movement and become entangled in the first square they enter.\n\nThe spell can also be used to create a sticky coating on an item. A creature holding a targeted item can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the spell’s DC. If the initial saving throw succeeds, the item is unaffected. If it fails, the item is stuck in place. If an affected item is connected to another item (such as a sword in a sheath or a cork in a potion bottle), it cannot be separated from the other item unless the creature succeeds at a combat maneuver check or a Strength check as a move action to free it (DC = the spell’s DC). A creature must succeed at saving throw each time it attempts to use the sticky item; otherwise, the item becomes stuck to the creature. Sticky armor or clothing imposes a –10 circumstance penalty on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple attempted by the wearer, as well as to the wearer’s CMD to avoid being grappled."

        "description": "This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A _glyph of warding_ can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.\n\nYou set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded.\n\nWhen casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.\n\nGlyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. [Mislead](/spells/mislead), [polymorph](/spells/polymorph), and [nondetection](/spells/nondetection) (and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though non-magical disguises and the like can’t. [Read magic](/spells/read-magic) allows you to identify a _glyph of warding_ with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).\n\nDepending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.\n\n*   _Blast Glyph_: A _blast glyph_ deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster’s choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.\n*   _Spell Glyph_: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph."

Creatures in the affected area can be weighed down by high gravity, lightened by low gravity, or left to float in an area with no gravity, depending on the effect you choose for your gravity sphere.\n\nCreatures that fall within the area of a gravity sphere spell take more damage from the fall if the gravity within is higher and less damage if the gravity within is lower. However, if the creature falls through a gravity sphere and continues to fall in a non-affected area, the rest of the fall damage is calculated normally. For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a low-gravity sphere and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low gravity plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).\n\nThis spell doesn’t counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect gravity; both effects occur simultaneously. For instance, a no-gravity gravity sphere spell cast within the area of a [reverse gravity](/spells/reverse-gravity) spell would simply mean that creatures float about until the gravity sphere’s duration expires or they exit the gravity sphere, at which point they return to the top of the [reverse gravity](/spells/reverse-gravity) effect’s area. If both gravity-altering magical effects could not feasibly take place simultaneously (at the GM’s discretion), the gravity sphere spell supersedes the previous effect (if it’s higher-level than the previous effect) or simply fails (if it’s lower-level)."

If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires.\n\nIt can’t recover this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target’s skin might turn green and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target’s skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment.\n\nIf the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub.\n\nThis final transformation is instantaneous, ending _green caress_.\n\nThe target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn’t occur and the spell ends. Any changes in appearance gradually reverse themselves as the ability damage heals.\n\n[Break enchantment](/spells/break-enchantment), [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic), and [remove curse](/spells/remove-curse) can end the spell before the duration expires, but the spell is contagious.\n\nIf a caster level check attempt to remove green caress fails by 5 or more, the creature who attempted to remove the effect must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as if it had just been targeted with the spell. If the spell’s target attempts to remove the effect from itself and fails, it causes the spell to behave as if affected by [plant growth](/spells/plant-growth) (as described below).\n\n[Polymorph any object](/spells/polymorph-any-object) ends the spell and totally restores the target without any risk to the caster, even after the target has been finally transformed, as do [limited wish](/spells/limited-wish), [miracle](/spells/miracle), and [wish](/spells/wish) (treat [polymorph any object](/spells/polymorph-any-object) as if it had an instantaneous duration if it is used in this way).

If the target is in the area of [diminish plants](/spells/diminish-plants) as it is cast, it ignores the next ability damage from green caress to one of its three physical ability scores (chosen randomly); this doesn’t stack with multiple castings of [diminish plants](/spells/diminish-plants)."

Its duration continues to elapse while it is suppressed this way.\n\nNormally, the area of effect is 40 feet from the touched object.\n\nIf the touched object is a monument to human achievement, the area increases to a 60-foot radius."

The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.\n\n_Fog_: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). **Saving Throw**: none. **Spell Resistance**: no.\n\n_Arcane Locks_: All doors in the warded area are [arcane locked](/spells/arcane-lock). **Saving Throw**: none. [](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Resistance)**Spell Resistance**: no.\n\n_Webs_: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom.

This is a mind-affecting effect. **Saving Throw**: none. **Spell Resistance**: yes.\n\n_Lost Doors_: One door per caster level is covered by a [silent image](/spells/silent-image) to appear as if it were a plain wall. **Saving Throw**: Will disbelief (if interacted with). **Spell Resistance**: no.\n\nIn addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.\n\n[Dancing lights](/spells/dancing-lights) in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. **Saving Throw**: none. **Spell Resistance**: no.\n\nA _magic mouth_ in two places. **Saving Throw**: none. **Spell Resistance**: no.\n\nA [stinking cloud](/spells/stinking-cloud) in two places.

You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the [suggestion](/spells/suggestion) mentally. **Saving Throw**: Will negates. **Spell Resistance**: yes.\n\nThe whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic) cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful [mage’s disjunction](/spells/mage_s-disjunction) destroys the entire _guards and wards_ effect."

The sphere’s CMB for bull rush combat maneuvers uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +2 bonus for its Strength score (14). Whether or not the bull rush is successful, the creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal bludgeoning damage from the attack.

If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards.\n\nRecord the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card’s alignment matches the target creature’s alignment. If the card and target’s alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit’s check. If the card and target’s alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a –1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit’s check.\n\nWhile penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can “spend” at any time to modify that card’s associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell’s duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed.\n\nA single creature can only be under the effects of one harrowing at a time. If it is subjected to a second harrowing while a previous harrowing is still in effect, the new harrowing automatically fails.\n\nAssociated Suit Checks\n| Suit | Associated check |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hammer (Str) | Attack rolls (ranged and melee) |\n| Key (Dex) | Reflex saving throws |\n| Shield (Con) | Fortitude saving throws |\n| Book (Int) | Skill checks |\n| Star (Wis) | Will saving throws |\n| Crown (Cha) | Any d20 roll |\n\nOpposition Alignments\n| Alignment | Opposition |\n| --- | --- |\n| LG | CE |\n| NG | NE |\n| CG | LE |\n| LN | CN |\n| N | LG, LE, CG, or CE  \n(pick one when spell is cast) |\n| CN | LN |\n| LE | CG |\n| NE | NG |\n| CE | LG |"

It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can’t pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell."

If the magic circle ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one _holy sword_ at a time.\n\nIf this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with [bless weapon](/spells/bless-weapon) or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon’s bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack."

There’s a 25% chance on each of the creature’s turns that it can’t overcome its hunger. If so, it must move directly toward the nearest corporeal creature of its type and subtype (if applicable) and make a bite attack against it. If the target lacks enough actions to attack on that turn, it moves as close to the creature as it can, but on its next turn, if the percentile dice indicate it overcomes its hunger, the target is not forced to pursue or attack further.\n\nOn any round after the target deals damage to another creature of its own type and subtype (if applicable) with its bite attack, the target loses the staggered condition. If it doesn’t continue dealing bite damage to applicable creatures, the target regains the staggered condition at the beginning of its next turn."

You may cause a number of ice spears equal to one spear for every four caster levels you possess to burst from the ground. A creature that occupies a square from which a spear extends (or that is within 10 feet of the ground below) takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of cold damage per square—creatures that take up more than one square can be hit by multiple spears if the caster is high enough level. The explosive growth can also trip foes. When the spears erupt from the ground, they make a combat maneuver check against any targets that take damage from the spears, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Each additional ice spear beyond the first that strikes a single foe grants a +10 bonus to this CMB check. If the check succeeds, the ice spears knock the foe prone. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the trip attempt.\n\nIf you cast this spell upon an area covered with ice or snow, such as atop a glacier, frozen lake, or snow-covered field, the spears strike with additional force. Saves against the effect suffer a –2 penalty and the spell gains a +4 bonus on its combat maneuver check to trip foes. Ice spears created by this spell remain after they do their damage. They melt as normal depending on the surrounding environment. They no longer damage foes in their square, but can provide cover. An ice spear has hardness 5 and 30 hit points."

The crowd appears to be a group of typical citizens, and cannot duplicate any specific group, guild, or military squad.\n\nThe crowd affects movement and provides cover like a real crowd, but anyone who disbelieves the illusion can move and attack through the crowd without impediment. Each round a creature enters or makes an attack through a crowd-filled square, it can attempt a save to disbelieve the illusion. Similarly, any creature that spends a round listening to or talking to the crowd can attempt a save to disbelieve the illusion. If the group is placed in any terrain other than urban, each creature attempting a save to disbelieve the spell gains a +5 bonus on the save.\n\n ![](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257694/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257694&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=DBWOIQO4ITNW4EF3) ![](http://d20pfsrd.opengamingnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/irthttpwwwd20pfs-20amplas2ampo-2ampa-260-2257694-2)  Get this book AND support this site!"

Only cleric spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration (healing) can be transferred. The number and level of spells that the subject can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of _imbue with spell ability_ can’t exceed this limit.\n\nThe transferred spell’s variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and the like) function according to your level, not the level of the recipient.\n\nOnce you cast _imbue with spell ability_, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued spells or is slain, or until you dismiss the _imbue with spell ability_ spell. In the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put. If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active _imbue with spell ability_ spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.\n\nTo cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic component, it must be able to move freely. To cast a spell with a material component or focus, it must have the materials or focus."

Only permanent magic items may be enhanced by this spell—one-use items and charged items cannot be affected by impart mind. Intelligent magic items cannot be affected by impart mind.\n\nWhen you cast _impart mind_ on a magic item, the item gains an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma score of 10 and gains your alignment. You have no special control over the item once it becomes intelligent, although since it has your alignment, personality conflicts with items you wield won’t be a problem. Determine the item’s ego normally, as per the rules on intelligent items in the Core Rulebook.\n\nAn item made intelligent via _impart mind_ communicates via speech and has normal senses to a range of 60 feet. It speaks and reads one language known by you—if you know multiple languages, you may choose which language the item knows.\n\nWhen you cast _impart mind_ on an item, roll once on **Table: Intelligent Item Powers** to randomly determine the item’s power—add your caster level to this roll. By expending additional diamond dust in excess of the 1,000 gp worth of material components required to cast this spell, you can gain further bonuses on the d% roll made to determine the item’s power. Every additional 100 gp in diamond dust you use in excess grants a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll, up to a maximum additional bonus equal to your caster level. If the item gains the ability to cast a spell, determine the spell it can cast randomly from spells you know of the appropriate level. If the item gains ranks in a skill, it gains ranks in a random skill in which you have at least 1 rank.\n\nIf you roll above 100, then you can choose one item power on **Table: Intelligent Item Powers** to grant the item, and the item gains a special purpose. Roll once on **Table: Intelligent Item Purpose** and **Table: Special Purpose Item Dedicated Powers** to determine what the item’s special purpose and dedicated powers are. These d% rolls are not modified by your caster level or any additional powdered gems you used to cast the spell.\n\nOnce this spell ends, the item reverts to its previous nature—if you cast this spell on the item again, it gains entirely different powers as determined by a new set of rolls.\n\nTable: Intelligent Item Powers\n| d% | Item Power | Base Price Modifier | Ego Modifier |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 01–10 | Item can cast a 0-level spell at will | +1,000 gp | +1 |\n| 11–20 | Item can cast a 1st-level spell 3/day | +1,200 gp | +1 |\n| 21–25 | Item can use magic aura on itself at will | +2,000 gp | +1 |\n| 26–35 | Item can cast a 2nd-level spell 1/day | +2,400 gp | +1 |\n| 36–45 | Item has 5 ranks in one skill\\* | +2,500 gp | +1 |\n| 46–50 | Item can sprout limbs and move with a speed of 10 feet | +5,000 gp | +1 |\n| 51–55 | Item can cast a 3rd-level spell 1/day | +6,000 gp | +1 |\n| 56–60 | Item can cast a 2nd-level spell 3/day | +7,200 gp | +1 |\n| 61–70 | Item has 10 ranks in one skill\\* | +10,000 gp | +2 |\n| 71–75 | Item can change shape into one other form of the same size | +10,000 gp | +2 |\n| 76–80 | Item can [fly](/spells/fly), as per the spell, at a speed of 30 feet | +10,000 gp | +2 |\n| 81–85 | Item can cast a 4th-level spell 1/day | +11,200 gp | +2 |\n| 86–90 | Item can [teleport](/spells/teleport) itself 1/day | +15,000 gp | +2 |\n| 91–95 | Item can cast a 3rd-level spell 3/day | +18,000 gp | +2 |\n| 96–100 | Item can cast a 4th-level spell 3/day | +33,600 gp | +2 |\n| \\* Intelligent items can only possess Intelligence\\-, Wisdom\\-, or Charisma\\-based skills, unless they also possess some form of ability to move. |\n\nTable: Intelligent Item Purpose\n| d% | Purpose | Ego Modifier |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 01–20 | Defeat/slay diametrically opposed alignment\\* | +2 |\n| 21–30 | Defeat/slay arcane spellcasters (including spellcasting monsters and those that use spell-like abilities) | +2 |\n| 31–40 | Defeat/slay divine spellcasters (including divine entities and servitors) | +2 |\n| 41–50 | Defeat/slay non-spellcasters | +2 |\n| 51–55 | Defeat/slay a particular creature type (see the bane special ability for choices) | +2 |\n| 56–60 | Defeat/slay a particular race or kind of creature | +2 |\n| 61–70 | Defend a particular race or kind of creature | +2 |\n| 71–80 | Defeat/slay the servants of a specific deity | +2 |\n| 81–90 | Defend the servants and interests of a specific deity | +2 |\n| 91–95 | Defeat/slay all (other than the item and the wielder) | +2 |\n| 96–100 | Choose one | +2 |\n| \\* The purpose of the neutral (N) version of this item is to preserve the balance by defeating/slaying powerful beings of the extreme alignments (LG, LE, CG, CE). |\n\nTable: Special Purpose Item Dedicated Powers\n| d% | Dedicated Power | Base Price Modifier | Ego Modifier |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 01–20 | Item can detect any special purpose foes within 60 feet | +10,000 gp | +1 |\n| 21–35 | Item can use a 4th-level spell at will | +56,000 gp | +2 |\n| 36–50 | Wielder gets +2 luck bonus on attacks, saves, and checks | +80,000 gp | +2 |\n| 51–65 | Item can use a 5th-level spell at will | +90,000 gp | +2 |\n| 66–80 | Item can use a 6th-level spell at will | +132,000 gp | +2 |\n| 81–95 | Item can use a 7th-level spell at will | +182,000 gp | +2 |\n| 96–100 | Item can use [true resurrection](/spells/true-resurrection) on wielder, once per month | +200,000 gp | +2 |"

To successfully cast this spell, no creature other than the devil’s challenger (see below) can be within this area while the spell is being cast.\n\nOn the round it appears, the devil identifies itself (typically by name and with a brief recitation of honors) and states it is prepared to do battle with a sole mortal champion. In the same round, either you or a creature you designate while casting the spell must identify the devil’s challenger. For the duration of the spell, the devil does everything in its power to kill the challenger. You do not control the devil or have any influence over how it conducts itself in battle, but the devil cannot leave the testing ground. Unlike with [summon monster](/spells/summon-monster) and similar spells, you cannot dismiss the devil. Rather, the conjured devil remains until any one of the following criteria is met: it is reduced below 0 hit points or otherwise defeated, its challenger is slain, its challenger leaves the testing ground, or it takes damage from any source other than its challenger. Upon any of these occurrences, the devil vanishes.\n\nConjuring a devil is typically an evil act. If cast for any purpose besides the administering of a Hell Knight test, this spell has the evil descriptor."

Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level, and can’t attack. Because of their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can attempt Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level.\n\nEach scout that returns passes along memories of specific structural flaws, defenses, and alarms, granting you the ability to reroll one failed skill check per scout, as long as the skill check involves that specific location’s layout, such as a Stealth check to sneak in, a Disable Device check to silence an alarm, or a Perception check to notice a trap. If even one scout returns, you also gain a rough understanding of the building’s layout (at least, any portions your scouts could access). All insight (and the associated rerolls) fades 1 hour per caster level you have after the scouts return. Your insects remember nothing about creatures, and so provide no information about guardians or any conversations they may overhear.\n\n![](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601258445/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601258445&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=fd1b8f484ae13edb2ab97989e30b8762) ![](http://d20pfsrd.opengamingnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/irthttpwwwd20pfs-20amplam2ampo-2ampa-260-2258445-2)"

In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can’t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer.\n\nFor example, an insect is unable to relay someone’s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.\n\nEach insects’ size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability).

The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a +16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being climbed is, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of +0 for Huge or larger creatures).\n\nYou also maintain a faint mystical connection with these insects, which allows you to sense where they are.

If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.\n\nItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.\n\nOf course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as [bless](/spells/bless) that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.\n\n_Invisibility_ can be made permanent (on objects only) with a [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell."

At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round—this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell’s duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end.\n\nYou must worship a single divinity in order to cast this spell, even if you do not normally cast divine spells. If you perform an action that blatantly violates your deity’s precepts while under this spell’s effects, invoke deity immediately ends and you are stunned for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice.\n\nInvoke deity has the same alignment descriptors (\\[chaotic\\], \\[evil\\], \\[good\\], or \\[lawful\\]) as your deity’s alignment. If an ability duplicates a spell, it functions as that spell heightened to a level equal to your invoke deity spell.\n\n*   **Air**: You become wispy and translucent. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability, or you increase your current fly speed by 30 feet—whichever results in a faster speed. While flying, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC.\n*   **Animal**: Your form becomes bestial with animalistic features. You gain low-light vision, scent, a +6 natural armor bonus, and a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size. If you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you increased one size category. You can use [speak with animals](/spells/speak-with-animals) at will.\n*   **Artifice**: Parts of your body are replaced by pistons and gears. You can be affected by spells that specifically affect constructs (such as [make whole](/spells/make-whole)). You are immune to bleed, disease, and poison effects, and you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, mind-affecting effects, and necromancy effects.\n*   **Chaos**: Your flesh churns and swirls chaotically. You are immune to additional damage from critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attack damage), and weapons you wield count as chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n*   **Charm**: You become overwhelmingly attractive and persuasive. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma.\n*   **Community**: Your voice echoes with the sound of multitudes. Select a number of creatures within 30 feet equal to your level divided by three—you gain the effects of [status](/spells/status) and [telepathic bond](/spells/telepathic-bond) with those creatures.\n*   **Darkness**: Your eyes become solid black orbs. You become immune to blindness and can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a [deeper darkness](/spells/deeper-darkness) spell.\n*   **Death**: Your flesh becomes pallid. You are healed by both positive and negative energy, are immune to [energy drain](/spells/energy-drain) and death effects, and automatically stabilize when reduced below 0 hit points.\n*   **Destruction**: The air around you crackles. You gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with two-handed melee weapons. Spells you cast that cause hit point damage have their save DCs (if any) increased by 1. You gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to break objects, and you ignore the first 5 points of hardness any object has when you attack it with a melee weapon.\n*   **Earth**: Your flesh becomes stony.

You automatically confirm critical hits, and weapons you wield count as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n*   **Fire**: Your hair ignites into flames. You are immune to fire. As a standard action once per minute, you can fire a ray of flame, as per [scorching ray](/spells/scorching-ray) (limit one ray).\n*   **Glory**: Your countenance becomes stern and implacable, and your wrath devastates the undead. You gain the benefits of [heroism](/spells/heroism) and [protection from evil](/spells/protection-from-evil), and your first successful attack each round against an undead target deals an additional 1d6 points of positive energy damage.\n*   **Good**: Your appearance becomes pristine and angelic. You are immune to fear and compulsion effects, and weapons you wield count as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n*   **Healing**: Your appearance becomes hale and hearty. You gain fast healing 3, and your spells and class features that restore hit points each restore an additional 1d8 hit points.\n*   **Knowledge**: You are surrounded by the sound of numerous turning pages. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.\n*   **Law**: A haze of mathematical symbols hovers around you. You are immune to hostile transmutation effects and all [confusion](/spells/confusion) effects, and weapons you wield count as lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\n*   **Liberation**: Your form becomes lithe and flexible. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.\n*   **Luck**: The faint sound of tinkling bells plays around you. You gain a +1 luck bonus to your Armor Class and on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks. As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled—you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of invoke deity decreases by 10 minutes, and you can’t use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell’s duration.\n*   **Madness**: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality. As a standard action, you can inflict madness on a creature within 30 feet; that creature must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. You cannot target a creature more than once a minute with this effect.\n*   Magic: You shimmer with magical power. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your caster level against hostile spells.\n*   **Nobility**: Your voice becomes resonant and imperious. As a move action, you can issue one order to a single creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as if you had cast the spell [command](/spells/command).\n*   **Plant**: Your appearance becomes plantlike, with leafy hair and green skin. You become immune to paralysis, poison, [polymorph](/spells/polymorph) effects, [sleep](/spells/sleep) effects, and stunning.\n*   **Protection**: An aura of protective energy surrounds you. Select three of the following spells: [delay poison](/spells/delay-poison), [false life](/spells/false-life), [mage armor](/spells/mage-armor), [protection from chaos](/spells/protection-from-chaos), [protection from evil](/spells/protection-from-evil), [protection from good](/spells/protection-from-good), [protection from law](/spells/protection-from-law), [resist energy](/spells/resist-energy), [shield](/spells/shield), or [shield of faith](/spells/shield-of-faith); you gain the protective benefits of those spells.\n*   **Repose**: Your eyes become pure, bleak white. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom.\n*   **Rune**: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of glyphs of warding, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use [read magic](/spells/read-magic) at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll’s caster level.\n*   **Scalykind**: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.\n*   **Strength**: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength.\n*   **Sun**: Your form blazes with solar light. You are immune to blindness, the dazzled condition, and all effects generated by powerful light (such as [searing light](/spells/searing-light), sunray, or the blinding light of a shining child), and you radiate light as the [daylight](/spells/daylight) spell. Creatures that are harmed or hindered by sunlight take a –2 penalty on attack rolls against you, and you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects originating from such creatures.\n*   **Travel**: Faint afterimages trail behind you when you move. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution.\n*   **Trickery**: Your appearance changes as you desire (as [veil](/spells/veil), except affecting only yourself). Changing your appearance is a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks.\n*   **Void**: Your clothes and hair seem to float about you, as if you were adrift in a weightless environment. You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe. You can exist comfortably in the depths of outer space.\n*   **War**: You are surrounded by the sounds of battle. You gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls with your deity’s favored weapon and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with your deity’s favored weapon each time you hit a foe. You can use your deity’s favored weapon as a divine focus or holy symbol.\n*   **Water**: You gain gills, webbed fingers, and other ichthyic features. You gain a swim speed of 40 feet, can breathe water, and ignore the usual penalties on weapon attack and damage rolls from fighting underwater.\n*   **Weather**: Your hair and clothing are constantly wind-tossed, and you crackle with electricity. You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather. You are immune to electricity damage, and your [call lightning](/spells/call-lightning) and [call lightning storm](/spells/call-lightning-storm) spells and effects always function as though called outdoors in stormy weather."

        "description": "This spell must be cast as you activate wild shape to assume the form of an animal of at least Large size. When you assume the animal form, it takes on many of the primal characteristics of the savage, prehistoric creatures that dwell in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. When this spell’s duration expires, you return to your natural form automatically-in effect, you shorten the duration of that use of wild shape to the duration of this spell when you cast invoke primal power.\n\nIn addition to the normal effects you gain upon assuming the wild shape, you also gain a +4 size bonus to your Constitution score and increase the natural armor bonus granted by the effect by 2 (thus, if you assume the size of a Large animal as if via [beast shape](/spells/beast-shape) II, your natural armor bonus is +6 instead of +4). Furthermore, you gain one of the following additional abilities while you are in your enhanced wild shape form. At caster level 13th, you gain two of the following abilities, and at caster level 17th, you gain three of the abilities.\n\n**Cold Resistance**: Your new body is covered with thick layers of fur and insulating blubber. You gain cold resistance 30.\n\n**Ferocity**: You remain conscious and can continue to fight even if your hit point total is below 0. You are still staggered and lose 1 hit point each round, and still die when your hit point total reaches a negative amount equal to your Constitution score.\n\n**Giant Slayer**: Your new form is particularly suited for slaying giants. Against creatures with the giant subtype, you gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and on damage rolls with your new form’s natural attacks.\n\n**Powerful Charge**: Choose one of the natural attacks you gain from your new form. When you make a charge attack, this natural attack deals 2d6 additional points of damage in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge. This damage applies only to the first attack you make when you perform your charge.\n\n**Rend**: Once per round, if you hit the same target with two or more natural attacks in a round, you rend the target of those attacks, dealing 2d6 additional points of damage.\n\n**Swift**: Your new form’s base speed increases by 20 feet.\n\n**Trample**: As a full-round action, you can attempt to overrun any creature that is at least one size category smaller than you. This works just like the overrun combat maneuver, but you do not need to attempt a check; you merely have to move over your opponents. Targets take damage equal to 2d6 plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier from your trample, and can make attacks of opportunity against you, but at a -4 penalty. If a targets forgoes an attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the trample and take half damage. The save DC against this effect is equal to 10 + half your caster level + your Strength modifier. You can deal only trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.\n\n**Trip**: Choose one of the natural attacks granted to you by your new form. Up to once per round, you can attempt to trip an opponent as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity if you hit with the specified attack. If the attempt fails, you are not tripped in return."

You have an arcane spell failure chance of 35% and a -6 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor.

At the completion of the spell’s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.\n\nThe casting of judgment undone is not without risk. The servants vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell’s 10-minute casting time, an olethros appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless judgment undone has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment—how successful she may be depends on the GM’s discretion.\n\nThe caster of judgment undone can pause the spell’s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on judgment undone and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.\n\nIt is possible to cast judgment undone without incurring the [wrath](/spells/wrath) of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life.\n\nThe details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM’s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast judgment undone is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it’s not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell’s casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell’s material component, information about the required focus, or even both."

If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the those of the new one become active.\n\nWhen you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, it affects up to four creatures—the creature the bomb hit directly, and up to three other creatures damaged by the splash (alchemist’s choice). Those creatures must succeed at a Will saving throw or become fatigued."

[Detect poison](/spells/detect-poison) and similar effects detect _languid venom_ only with a successful caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level (rolled secretly by the GM). Even if the poison is detected, the DC of Craft (alchemy) or Wisdom checks to identify the poison is increased by 10. If a poison is affected by an additional effect that requires a caster level check to detect the poison or increases the DC to identify it—such as obscure poison—those effects don’t stack. Use only the caster level check with the higher DC and increase the DC of the check to identify the poison by the higher of the two.\n\nIf cast upon a venomous creature, _languid venom_ delays the onset of that creature’s poison when the creature next delivers its natural poison."

If you strike your target, he takes a 1d6 penalty to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution each round. This penalty cannot reduce any attribute to less than 1, and once any of these attributes reaches 1 the target collapses and his body, except his head, becomes paralyzed. While paralyzed in this way, the target retains full use of his senses, including the ability to feel pain, and can speak (including casting spells with only verbal components). The whip has a maximum length of 20 feet, 15 hit points, and a hardness of 5. The spell ends immediately if you let go of the whip or it is destroyed. When the spell ends, all penalties the target took from this spell also end.\n\nFAQ\n\n**How does this spell work?**\n\n_Limp lash_ suffers a bit from using game terms as general descriptive text. Here are some clarifications.\n\n**1\\. You strike the target with the whip, he start taking ability penalties, is he paralyzed or hindered in any other way?**\n\nHe is not paralyzed until the ability penalty reduces the victim’s effective Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution to 1 (the minimum to which this spell can adjust a score). Once one of these 3 scores is reduced to 1, the victim becomes paralyzed—he is not paralyzed before this point.\n\n**2\\. The whip has a maximum range of 20 ft. If the target is not paralyzed or otherwise prevented from moving, what happens when he moves out of the 20 ft range? The spell dissipates or…?**\n\nIf the target moves out of range, the spell ends. (This is similar to what happens if you let go of the whip.) This does mean it’s relatively easy for a victim to escape from the spell—that is by design, since otherwise the fact that there’s no save to resist the penalties is pretty powerful.\n\n**3\\. Can you take any actions while holding the whip?**\n\nYou can take any action you want, but if any action requires you to release your hold on the whip, the _limp lash_ spell immediately ends.\n\n**4\\. What happens if some effect attempts to displace the whip (e.g. [wall of stone](/spells/wall-of-stone) between you and the target), or some effect moves the target away (e.g. bull rush)?**\n\nThe spell effect ends if something moves the target out of range or completely breaks the line of effect between you and the target.\n\n\\[source\\]"

The monkeys attempt one disarm or steal combat maneuver each turn as a free action against any creature that begins its turn in the swarm, using your caster level plus your casting ability score bonus (Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for druids and oracles; Charisma for bards, sorcerers, and summoners) for its CMB. Recovering an item from the monkeys requires a successful disarm or steal attempt against that CMB +10. An object stolen by the monkeys takes swarm damage each round the swarm is in possession of the object."

This spell targets only creatures with the ooze type, creatures with the amorphous special ability, and non-bipedal creatures with a special association with the Outer Gods. This music draws the targets’ attention to the caster, as per the fascinate bardic performance. It affects mindless creatures despite the mindless quality typically granting immunity to mind-affecting effects, though it doesn’t ignore any other immunity to mind-affecting effects the creature might have. The caster doesn’t have to maintain the effect each round—the music continues for the duration of the spell. Creatures fascinated by _mad sultan’s melody_ become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24 hours after the spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks on any of its targets for any reason (such as an attack).\n\nIf you have the bardic performance class feature and the fascinate bardic performance, you can choose to use the spell’s saving throw DC or a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your levels in the class that grants you bardic performance + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. If you choose to use the latter DC, each round of the melody costs 1 round of bardic performance and it counts as an active performance for determining how many performances you can have active.\n\nThis spell takes a toll on the caster. Each time you cast it, you take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity rules, you instead take 2d6 points of sanity damage."

        "description": "This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19–20 and a critical multiplier of ×2.\n\nThe sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, goes out of your sight, or you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers.\n\nEach round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round’s target.\n\nThe sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic), [disintegrate](/spells/disintegrate), a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. The sword’s AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).\n\nIf an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time _mage’s sword_ strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is [dispelled](/spells/dispel-magic). If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell."

        "description": "All creatures within the area gain the effects of a [protection from evil](/spells/protection-from-evil) spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature’s Spell Resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of [protection from evil](/spells/protection-from-evil)), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’ Spell Resistance.\n\nThis spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A _magic circle against evil_ can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a non-good called creature (such as those called by the _[lesser planar binding](/spells/planar-binding), [planar binding](/spells/planar-binding)_, and [greater planar binding](/spells/planar-binding) spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the _magic circle_. The creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal [protection from evil](/spells/protection-from-evil) spell for that creature only.\n\nA _magic circle_ leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has Spell Resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its Spell Resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (_[astral projection](/spells/astral-projection), [blink](/spells/blink), [dimension door](/spells/dimension-door), [etherealness](/spells/etherealness), [gate](/spells/gate), [plane shift](/spells/plane-shift), [shadow walk](/spells/shadow-walk), [teleport](/spells/teleport)_, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature’s extra-dimensional escape by casting a [dimensional anchor](/spells/dimensional-anchor) spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the _magic circle_ does. The creature cannot reach across the _magic circle_, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\n\nYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the _magic circle_ more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\n\nA successful diagram allows you to cast a [dimensional anchor](/spells/dimensional-anchor) spell on the _magic circle_ during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the _magic circle_ for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its Spell Resistance against a _magic circle_ prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the [lesser planar binding](/spells/planar-binding) spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram – even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.\n\nThis spell is not cumulative with [protection from evil](/spells/protection-from-evil) and vice versa."

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the _magic jar_. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the _magic jar_ must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.\n\nWhile in the _magic jar_, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)\n\nYou could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.\n\nAttempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by [protection from evil](/spells/protection-from-evil) or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature’s soul into the _magic jar_ unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the _magic jar_, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.\n\nIf you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the _magic jar_. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body’s extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.\n\nAs a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the _magic jar_ if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.\n\nIf the host body is slain, you return to the _magic jar_, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.\n\nIf the spell ends while you are in the _magic jar_, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the _magic jar_ returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be [dispelled](/spells/dispel-magic) at either the _magic jar_ or the host’s location."

        "description": "This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. _Magic mouth_ can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.\n\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical [darkness](/spells/darkness) or [invisibility](/spells/invisibility) does. Silent movement or magical [silence](/spells/silence) defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A _magic mouth_ cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.\n\nThe range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a _magic mouth_ to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.\n\n_Magic mouth_ can be made permanent with a [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell."

Objects secured to a nonmetallic fixture remain where they are unless a forceful tug would be enough to detach them. Loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected.

A creature can drop a metal object it’s holding as a free action to avoid the effect if it’s not wearing metal armor; a creature being dragged by its shield can loosen it as a move action and drop it as a free action.

When a creature within the mantle’s radius attacks you or attempts to affect you with a harmful effect, it must succeed at a Will save as these spectres of uncertainty force themselves into its mind. Ongoing effects trigger the mantle only if the creature consciously directs them against you. A given creature need only roll a saving throw against your _mantle of doubt_ at most once per round. If the creature’s attack or effect against you was a psychic spell or spell-like ability, that creature’s save takes a –4 penalty. A creatures that fails its save against your _mantle of doubt_ is affected for 1d4+1 rounds, during which time it is shaken, cannot flank, and no longer threatens creatures within its reach. In addition, it takes a –2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting effects, which stacks with the penalties for being shaken. If your _mantle of doubt_ affects a creature that is already shaken, that creature’s fear level doesn’t increase. Instead, mounting doubts stagger the creature for 1 round and deal 1d4 points of Wisdom and Charisma damage to it.\n\nSpell resistance applies against assaults from a _mantle of doubt_, and immunity to fear or mind-affecting effects negates the spell’s effects. If you are immune to fear or mind-affecting effects, you can still cast _mantle of doubt_ on yourself.\n\n ![](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257856/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257856&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=KXZRYKU2EBIOL4LF) \n\n![](http://d20pfsrd.opengamingnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/irthttpwwwd20pfs-20amplas2ampo-2ampa-260-2257856-2)\n\nGet this book AND support this site!"

Any of these types of energy can interact at any time, producing 64 possible combinations. It is believed that those 64 combinations are sufficient to describe the basis of every interaction in the cosmos. No matter the plane, creature, or time in question, every event in the multiverse is based on one of those 64 templates. In short, the Path of Numbers is a periodic table of energetic elements.\n\nTable: Eight Basic Energies\n| d8 | Energy Type | Magic School | d20 Roll |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Air | Enchantment | Will saves |\n| 2 | Electricity | Illusion | Reflex saves |\n| 3 | Fire | Necromancy | Attack rolls |\n| 4 | Sonic | Evocation | Initiative rolls |\n| 5 | Acid | Abjuration | Fortitude saves |\n| 6 | Water | Transmutation | Caster level checks |\n| 7 | Cold | Divination | Concentration checks |\n| 8 | Earth | Conjuration | Combat Maneuver Checks |\n\nUsing the Path of Numbers, you are able to influence the seemingly random elements in the environment around a creature, reducing that creature’s efficacy. Roll 3d8 and choose one of the dice—this die’s result is the penalty mathematical curse imparts. Next, choose either of the two remaining dice; the d20 roll corresponding to that result on the Eight Basic Energies table is the roll the spell’s penalty applies to. The result of the final die represents the number of rounds that mathematical curse lasts. A creature can be under the influence of only one mathematical curse at a time. If mathematical curse is cast on a creature already affected by that spell, the new curse replaces the previous one."

Roll on the following table each time the creature attempts an Intelligence check to escape the maze to see which part of the maze it wanders through; if a creature doesn’t attempt an Intelligence check, it stays in the same section and suffers that section’s effects. Any conditions or damage taken persist for the listed duration even if the creature exits the maze before then, but conditions don’t stack with themselves.\n\n| d% | Maze Section |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1–20 | Circus |\n| 21–40 | Haunted forest |\n| 41–60 | Hellscape |\n| 61–80 | Oasis of respite |\n| 81–100 | Strange city  \n |\n\n**Circus:** The creature finds itself in a nightmarish circus of giant beasts, garishly painted faces, and hideous, mocking laughter. The creature must succeed at a Will save or gain a lesser madness. The save uses the madness’s normal DC.\n\n**Haunted Forest**: The creature travels through a dark forest of grasping trees while shadowy beasts prowl at the edge of its vision. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. This is a fear effect. A frightened creature can still attempt Intelligence checks to escape the maze, but it takes 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage from the trees’ branches.\n\n**Hellscape**: The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become paralyzed by fear and potential torment for 1 round. This is a fear effect. The creature can’t attempt to escape the maze while paralyzed, and if it fails three consecutive saving throws against this paralysis, the hellscape delivers a coup de grace, dealing the creature 4d6 points of fire damage. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or die. A creature that survives the coup de grace escapes from the paralysis as well.\n\n**Oasis of Respite**: Whether it appears as a beautiful glade, a perfumed palace, or a literal desert oasis, this section of the maze is supernaturally peaceful, especially in comparison to the rest of the maze. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. The creature can’t attempt to escape the maze while fascinated. A creature that fails three consecutive saving throws to this fascination enters a state of lethargy and gives up ever escaping the maze, remaining in this area until the spell ends on its own in 10 minutes (as per [maze](/spells/maze)).\n\n**Strange City**: The creature journeys through a city of cyclopean architecture under a sky of indescribable color and numerous stars. The creature must succeed at a Will save or take 2d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity rules, the creature instead takes 2d10 points of sanity damage."

After 7 days, the shell crumbles away and the subject emerges, its body’s severed limbs, broken bones, and ruined organs regrown (as per [regenerate](/spells/regenerate)).\n\nIf the gemstone you use for the component is worth at least 5,000 gp, metabolic molting can bring a target back to life, as long as it has been dead for no more than 1 hour when the spell is cast. When the spell is used on such a creature, the creature comes back to life after 7 days and stabilizes at 0 hit points. A creature brought back to life through metabolic molting gains 1 permanent negative level, or 2 points of Constitution drain if it is 1st level. Like [raise dead](/spells/raise-dead), this spell can’t save creatures slain by death effects."

When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.\n\nIf you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere’s fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target’s space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.\n\nOnce a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.\n\n### By the way…\n\nThis spell can start fires on a ship."

There is no match if they are from different species, or if one sample is merely stage blood.\n\nAlternatively, you can compare dissimilar items and know if they have a potential relationship. For instance, you can compare a creature’s tooth against a bite mark and know if that creature could have caused the bite mark.\n\nThis spell is not infallible—an identical match can result from comparing items or creatures that are duplicates of one another.\n\nFor instance, a knife might have an identical match with a stab wound if an identical knife was used to inflict the wound, and twins might have identical blood or tissues."

        "description": "You or other creatures enter into or escape from a mindscape through an imaginary doorway. This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.\n\nWhen you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door’s conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a mindscape door to it.\n\nIf you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can’t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a mindscape door within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.\n\nWhen you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you from creating the door if she is within the mindscape. The two doors operate as if you’d cast the spell outside a mindscape.\n\nYou still designate who can use the door from the real world to get into the mindscape, but you can’t prevent creatures within the mindscape from exiting to the real world.\n\nTypically, a mindscape door operates in both directions, but you can create it as a one-way door if you so choose. Unlike with other spells, you can cast this spell as a full-round action while engaged in a psychic duel. This spell can be used to exit a binary mindscape, but not to enter one. If you successfully cast mindscape door within a veiled mindscape, you learn that you are in a mindscape, but other creatures observing the door don’t automatically realize they are."

Once a creature successfully saves, it becomes immune to being shaken by the caster’s _mirror mantis_ spell for 24 hours, though it will still see the crimson assassin reflection until the spell ends."

At will as an immediate action (but no more often than once every 10 minutes), a mischievous shadow can interfere with its host’s actions or the actions of adjacent creatures by interacting with their shadows in ways that affect their physical counterparts, such as grabbing the shadow of a crossbow to redirect the physical weapon’s aim. Each disruption either imposes a –8 penalty on a single attack roll, combat maneuver check, or Strength– or Dexterity\\-based skill check, or requires a spellcaster to succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) or lose a spell being cast. If you are within range of the spell effect, you can decide how these shadows interfere; otherwise, their actions are timed and decided by the GM as needed, typically manifesting during important or crucial roles.\n\nEach time a mischievous shadow makes such a disruption, the spell’s haunt\\-like manifestation occurs during that round.\n\nHAUNT STATISTICS\n\n**Notice** Perception DC 25 (to see a target’s shadow act incongruously with its physical motions); **hp** 2 hp/level; **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** none"

These new forms do not allow the subject to fly, run faster, or swim better; however, they do act as natural weapons of the appropriate type, and the subject can use them to make secondary attacks while making attacks with weapons as a full-attack action. The secondary attacks are made using the creature’s base attack bonus –5 and adding only 1/2 the creature’s Strength bonus on damage rolls. The subject cannot hold a weapon or use any item that would ordinarily fit into the slot of the changed extremity. The subject can receive the benefits of this spell multiple times."

The target doesn’t heal ability or hit point damage naturally and can’t prepare spells or regain spell slots. After one night of poor sleep, the target is fatigued (or exhausted if it was fatigued before trying to rest). A creature affected by this spell doesn’t recover from the fatigued or exhausted condition inflicted by this spell after resting, nor do spells such as [lesser restoration](/spells/restoration) provide any respite. Each restless night, the target takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, which also can’t be recovered by magic while night terrors is active.\n\nThe images from previous nightmares continue to haunt the target’s mind while awake. If the target has rested at least once while affected by night terrors and then becomes subjected to a fear condition, the target experiences the next higher level of fear than it would normally. However, per the alternate rules for fear, this spell cannot cause a lesser state of fear to become a greater one. If the effect causing the fear condition doesn’t usually stack with other fear effects, the target’s level of fear does not increase. This aspect of the spell is a fear effect.\n\nThe affected creature can attempt a new saving throw once per day to end night terrors, but multiple attempts to rest in a given day do not afford the target multiple saves. A creature that successfully saves against night terrors ends the spell and rests normally that night but gains the benefits of only that night’s rest, not any benefits missed on previous nights.\n\nIf your campaign uses the sanity rules, the target takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage."

The target can reroll the failed saving throw, but must take the new result even if it is worse.\n\n_Fortitude_: The target uses this ability when a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against it. The critical hit or sneak attack is negated and the damage is instead rolled normally.\n\n_Rejuvenate_: The target uses this ability when it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The target is instantly healed 3d6 points of damage. If enough hit points are regained to bring the target to positive hit points, it does not fall unconscious. If it is not enough to leave the target with positive hit points, the target automatically stabilizes. Both of these effects work even if the damage was originally enough to kill the target.\n\n_Shake Off_: The target uses this ability when it is under the effects of any of the following conditions: blinded, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, entangled, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, or staggered. Using this ability ends one of those conditions.\n\n_Shimmy Out_: The target uses this ability when it is grappled or pinned. The target automatically escapes the grapple as if it had succeeded at an Escape Artist check to escape the grapple.\n\n_Stay Up_: The target uses this ability when it is tripped or otherwise knocked prone. The target steadies itself and stays upright."

Next, allocate any number of the dice to represent the range of numerological resistance. The range of the spell is 10 × the sum of the allocated dice. Finally, add up the results of the dice remaining in the pool. This is the amount of damage that _numerological evocation_ deals to the first creature hit.

If there is already a natural spring within 1 mile, its water output is reduced by an amount equal to the water produced by this spell’s spring. A spring that has its water output reduced to 0 gallons per hour dries up and ceases to be a spring.\n\nThis spell functions differently depending on the terrain in which it’s cast. In a desert, you must succeed at a DC 25 caster level check to actually create the spring, and its output is 1 gallon of drinking water per caster level each day.\n\nFurthermore, in dry areas, erosion may cause the flow of water to be blocked if the affected area is left untended before a sufficient amount of vegetation has grown around it to keep the soil in place. In an arctic environment, low temperatures may cause the water to freeze. In a tropical environment, parasites may contaminate the water if the spring is created in a place where the water stands in a stagnant pool."

Any creature passing through or ending its turn in the space occupied by the sphere gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Twenty-four hours after gaining a negative level from the sphere, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC of this save is equal to the DC of this spell) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent.\n\nIf more than one orb (from different castings of the spell) enters the same space, the orbs automatically fuse together. The resulting orb uses the higher of the two orbs’ DCs as its DC and whichever duration has more time left. If the orbs are from different casters, each must make an opposed Intelligence check to move the sphere.\n\nAn undead creature that passes through or ends its turn in the space occupied by the orb gains 2d4 × 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour."

If the wielder doesn’t have a sheath or sling available for the weapon, failure on the Strength check causes the weapon to fall to the ground, at which point it requires a Strength check to pick up, as with unattended weapons."

If you are successful, you pull the target object to you, and if you have enough hands free, you can catch it. Otherwise, the object lands in your square as if you dropped it.\n\n_Careful Maneuver_: You attempt a Disable Device check or a Sleight of Hand check to pick-pocket a target within range. This spell lasts as long as you need to accomplish the task, requiring your full concentration for that duration. Once you resolve the skill check, the spell ends. If you are successful on your Sleight of Hand check, you pull the target object to you as with an abrupt maneuver. The target gains a +2 bonus on its Perception check to notice the successful attempt."

You grant the semblance of wakefulness to the target, allowing it to answer questions. You can ask one question per 2 caster levels. The target’s knowledge is limited to what it normally knows, including the languages it speaks. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you when awake. If the target succeeds at a Will save, it awakens (unless some force is preventing it from being awake, such as magic or drugs), and it remains aware of the first question you asked. If the target has been subject to pillow talk within the past week, the new spell fails. While your questions don’t otherwise wake the target, this spell does nothing to prevent other sounds or stimulus from waking the target. A target who sleeps through the spellcasting and duration of the spell has no memory of it taking place, but a target who awakens before the spell ends remembers every question asked and what answers it gave."

When you call a creature using planar inquiry, the only task that you can ask of the creature is for it to answer questions or gather information regarding a specific topic (a person, a place, or a thing). After hearing your request, if the creature has an appropriate Knowledge skill, it can attempt a check to provide the information it has. If it lacks such a skill, the called creature leaves for 1d4 hours to gather this information. Upon its return, you roll 1d20 + your caster level, and use the result to determine what information the creature has gathered about the subject (as if using Diplomacy). The called creature stays for up to 10 minutes as it relays this information to you, after which it departs to its home plane. If the creature is attacked or damaged at any time during the spell’s duration, the spell ends and the creature returns to the plane from which you summoned it.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can choose a specific kind of outsider to call, even calling an individual creature by name. The kind of outsider called doesn’t alter the effects of the spell, but when you use planar inquiry to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, the spell gains that descriptor. You cannot call an outsider whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level (maximum 18 HD) and you cannot use this spell to contact a unique outsider (such as a deity’s herald) or an outsider with mythic ranks."

Plant creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can communicate and understand only the simplest of concepts, such as “friend,” “food,” and “danger.” This spell has no effect on ordinary plants and fungus."

This bloodstone contains the essence and spirit of the sacrificed creature, allowing anyone holding the stone to activate the creature’s highest-level activated racial spell-like ability, taking the actions necessary to activate the stored spell-like ability. Any creature who holds the stone can activate it, but the stone can be used only once per day (or the frequency of the creature’s spell-like ability, whichever is less). If a creature has several racial spell-like abilities of the same spell level, choose randomly from among them to determine which one is stored in the bloodstone. The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like [invisibility](/spells/invisibility) (self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for [greater teleport](/spells/teleport) (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing [summon monster II](/spells/summon-monster) (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can’t store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp.\n\nThe save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as controlling the target of [dominate person](/spells/dominate-person). The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round’s worth of actions.\n\nIf the sacrificed creature doesn’t die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell’s duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power. The fragment of the creature’s spirit trapped in the bloodstone does not hinder attempts to restore the creature to life."

You can use this spell to transform all manner of objects and creatures into new forms- you aren’t limited to transforming a living creature into another living form.

If the target of the spell does not have mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), this spell grants a score of 5 to such scores. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force. A non-magical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren’t affected by this spell.\n\nThis spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine.

The panacea has no side effects (for example, the intoxication panacea does not cause a hangover). When you use _polypurpose panacea_, choose one of the following effects.\n\n_Analgesic_: You do not feel minor aches and pains, such as from arthritis, a cold, or a hangover, for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 resistance bonus against pain-related spells.\n\n_Clarity_: You get a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check within 1 minute. You must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.\n\n_Hallucination_: You have pleasant hallucinations for 1 hour, such as wandering lights, music, playful surreal animals, and so on. You can tell these are not real, but they are distracting, and you take a –2 penalty on Perception checks for the duration.\n\n_Intoxication_: You feel comfortably intoxicated for 1 hour, as if you had a few alcoholic beverages.\n\n_Lucid Dream_: If you take this panacea within 1 hour of going to sleep, you have a lucid dream that is under your control and lasts for an hour.\n\n_Resistance_: You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saves for 1 minute.\n\n_Sleep_: You enter a pleasant and restful sleep for at least 1 hour unless wakened. If you would normally begin sleeping at this time, when the panacea ends you continue sleeping normally.\n\n_Sobriety_: You become completely sober for 1 hour, negating any penalties to your actions for being drunk (GameMastery Guide 237). Magical and alchemical methods (such as [detect poison](/spells/detect-poison)) still detect you as inebriated. Time spent under the effect of this panacea do not count toward the time necessary to sober up (it merely delays your intoxication).\n\n_Tenacity_: You gain 1 temporary hit point for 1 minute.\n\n_Wakefulness_: You remain awake for 2 hours without feeling sleepy, and without side effects such as jitteriness. You gain a +5 resistance bonus against sleep-related spells such as [lullaby](/spells/lullaby) and [sleep](/spells/sleep). This use of the panacea merely delays your need for sleep and does not count as rest or sleep. You can use it multiple times in succession, but as each effect wears off, you are as tired as you would be had you not used the panacea."

The target creature must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body appears to be dead. Failure to take over a host ends the spell.\n\nIf you are successful, your life force occupies the host body. The host’s soul is imprisoned with you, but can still use its own senses (though it can’t assert any influence or use even purely mental abilities). You can communicate telepathically with the host as if you shared a common language, but only with your consent. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs doesn’t allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can’t activate the body’s extraordinary or supernatural abilities, nor can you cast any of its spells or spell-like abilities.\n\nAs a standard action, you can shift freely back to your own body regardless of range, so long as it remains on the same plane. If the host’s body is killed, you return to your own body and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If your body is slain, when the spell expires or the host’s body is killed, you are slain. It is possible to cast this spell on a new target from within another creature’s body; this resets the duration. You still return to your original body (not any intermediate body) when you take a standard action to do so or the spell’s duration expires. Returning to your body ends the spell. Creatures whose souls are their bodies, such as incorporeal undead and non-native outsiders, use the effects of greater possession instead.\n\nPossession, Greater\n\n**School** necromancy; **Level** occultist 6, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, spiritualist 6, witch 8\n\nCASTING\n\n**Casting Time** 1 standard action  \n**Components** V, S\n\nEFFECT\n\n**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  \n**Target** one creature  \n**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)  \n**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThis spell functions as _possession_, but when you possess a host, You enter the host’s body and your physical body vanishes.

Regardless of whether the possessor fails or succeeds at its save against possession trap, you immediately become aware of the possession attempt and whether or not a creature is trapped in the focus gem. If the focus gem is destroyed while it contains a creature, the creature is immediately released.

It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. _Prestidigitation_ can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a _prestidigitation_ spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, _prestidigitation_ lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour."

If no prophecy is accurate, you become aware of this. Even accurate prophecies are often vague, and how easy it is to determine details from one is up to the GM. |\n| 76–100 | You gain accurate visions of a single prophecy regarding the subject. You know what this prophecy means and what it foretells, it is generally accurate, and it comes in the form of a single statement, though the timeline for when the prophecy will come true might be vague. (For example, “Flames shall consume it within a month” if the subject is a tavern destined to burn, or “The murderer shall be discovered by a hero” if the subject is a murder victim.) |"

This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.\n\n**Third**, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

        "description": "This spell grants the caster limited control over the quintessence of an Outer Planes. The control granted by quintessence mastery can take one of two forms, depending on the version of the spell cast. Both versions can be cast only on one of the nine Outer Planes, for it is these planes, not the Transitive or Inner Planes, that are comprised of quintessence.\n\nPlanewarp: This allows the caster to create various objects or effects. When this spell is cast, you can replicate a number of effects from one or more of the following spells: [control water](/spells/control-water), [diminish plants](/spells/diminish-plants), [fog cloud](/spells/fog-cloud), [major creation](/spells/major-creation), [move earth](/spells/move-earth), [plant growth](/spells/plant-growth), [secure shelter](/spells/secure-shelter), [soften earth and stone](/spells/soften-earth-and-stone), [spike growth](/spells/spike-growth), [spike stones](/spells/spike-stones), [stone shape](/spells/stone-shape), [transmute mud to rock](/spells/transmute-mud-to-rock), [transmute rock to mud](/spells/transmute-rock-to-mud), [wall of stone](/spells/wall-of-stone), or [wall of thorns](/spells/wall-of-thorns). The total spell levels of effects to be created must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of [fog cloud](/spells/fog-cloud), [secure shelter](/spells/secure-shelter), and [soften earth and stone](/spells/soften-earth-and-stone) (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or [diminish plants](/spells/diminish-plants) and [spike stones](/spells/spike-stones) (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not [move earth](/spells/move-earth) and [plant growth](/spells/plant-growth) (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9).\n\nIf a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level—[control water](/spells/control-water), for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it’s a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards.\n\nThis list need not be exhaustive; at the GM’s discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended.\n\nShape Realm: This functions similarly to [create demiplane](/spells/create-demiplane), except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by the plane’s traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained. At the GM’s discretion, additional restrictions beyond those listed in the [create demiplane](/spells/create-demiplane) spell may limit this spell’s effects, and additional options for customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for 1 day per caster level. This version of quintessence mastery can be made permanent in the same way and for the same cost as [create demiplane](/spells/create-demiplane). This version of quintessence mastery does not function within the boundaries of a divine realm."

If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised. A spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.\n\nA raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.\n\nA creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be raised by this spell.

The target corpse must be fresh—either dead for no more than 24 hours or appropriately preserved by an effect such as gentle repose. While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while touching the living target with the focus item. As the spell is cast, the dead body’s flesh unravels like ribbons to sheathe the living target, who must be within one size category of the corpse. While the spell is in effect, the focus item must remain within 30 feet of the target living creature.\n\nThe living target gains the physical appearance and size of the corpse, and gains its abilities as defined in alter self as well as any immunities, weapon proficiencies, weaknesses, and spell resistance the dead target had while living. The living target gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the individual whose corpse is targeted by this spell. The disguise created by recorporeal incarnation lasts for a number of weeks equal to your caster level, or until the focus item is moved more than 30 feet away from the living target. When the effect ends, the living target returns to its normal form, sloughing off the corpse’s flesh.\n\nThe greatest strength of recorporeal incarnation is the difficulty of detecting it as a disguise. If subjected to detect magic, the living target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives off an aura of strong necromantic magic. True seeing does not reveal the living target’s true form, since the corpse’s flesh magically obscures it. The spell detect undead and similar effects indicate the living target is an undead creature, but the target is not truly undead, and is not affected by any other effects that target undead creatures. Recorporeal incarnation does not disguise the target’s alignment.\n\nIf the living target of recorporeal incarnation dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues. Any raise dead or similar spell cast upon that target resurrects that target, not the corpse flesh. Since recorporeal incarnation destroys the majority of the target corpse’s physical remains, the target corpse cannot be restored to life except by miracle, resurrection, true resurrection, or wish.\n\nRecorporeal incarnation can be made permanent by a 15th level caster using permanency with a material component worth 17,500 gp."

If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.\n\nSince the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.\n\nA reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject’s racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.\n\nIt’s possible for the change in the subject’s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.\n\nFor a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below. For non-humanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.\n\nA creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.\n\nThe reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.\n\nA [wish](/spells/wish) or a [miracle](/spells/miracle) spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.\n\nOfficial\n| d% | Incarnation | Str | Dex | Con |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 01 | Bugbear | +4 | +2 | +2 |\n| 02-13 | Dwarf | +0 | +0 |

This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark).\n\n_Second_, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, [cure light wounds](/spells/cure-light-wounds) cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast [prayer](/spells/prayer), that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target’s friendship with the cleric.\n\n_Third_, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.\n\nThis powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.\n\nThis mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use [atonement](/spells/atonement) to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; [remove curse](/spells/remove-curse) also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the reprobation."

The total number of points in the reservoir cannot exceed your caster level (to a maximum of 20 points at 20th level). As an immediate action, anytime before the spell’s duration expires, you can expend a number of points of energy from the reservoir, granting yourself an insight bonus on one skill check, attack roll, damage roll, or combat maneuver check, but you must do so before the roll is made. The bonus is equal to the number of points spent. For every five caster levels, you may call upon the reservoir one additional time (maximum of four times at 15th level).\n\nIf you are reduced to negative hit points while you are under the effect of this spell, the spell automatically release the remaining magic of the reservoir in a concussive blast of force. All creatures within a 15-foot radius take 1d6 points of force damage per 2 points remaining in the reserve (maximum of 10d6). A successful Reflex save halves this damage, and spell resistance applies to this effect."

This animated object has average hit points and, if the armor is made from metal, it has the metal animated object extraordinary ability (plus additional abilities based on the type of metal). Once animated, the _revenant armor_ remains standing (and stands if knocked prone, doing so without provoking attacks of opportunity), and prevents the wearer of the armor from being considered helpless. If an ally of the wearer is within range of the armor, she can direct it to move, though it refuses to go anywhere that requires a skill check. If grappled or otherwise restrained, it can attempt to break free with a Strength score equal to your caster level and a CMB equal to 1 + your caster level + the armor’s Strength modifier. If the armor’s wearer is reduced to dust, made conscious, or removed from the armor, the spell ends."

Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface—you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.\n\nAny Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.\n\nThe walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid, strange chewing vermin, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift’s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift’s walls have a Climb DC of 25.\n\nWhen this spell’s duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift’s environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.\n\nAt any time during the spell’s duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell’s duration and [returning](/spells/returning-weapon) any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area; these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via [summon monster](/spells/summon-monster) VII and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the [rift of ruin](/spells/rift-of-ruin) spell. You can choose to summon one of the following: one bebilith, one vrock, 1d3 shadow demons, 1d3 succubi, 1d4+1 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraks."

Only one type of construction can be created with each casting of the spell, and the creation remains stationary unless destroyed.\n\nEach 5-foot section of the object created by this spell has a break DC of 23, AC 11, and 1 hit point per caster level (maximum 10 hp), but all sections of the creation are magically supported and need not be anchored to a solid surface or any other portion of the effect. Destroying one part of it does not cause the remainder of the structure to collapse, though each 5-foot section destroyed reduces the maximum weight the creation can support by 200 pounds. During any round in which the rope is overloaded, every remaining section takes 1d4 points of damage.\n\nYou can use _ropeweave_ to create any of the following structures:\n\n*   **Rope Bridge**: the rope forms a 5-foot-wide bridge that spans up to 10 feet horizontally per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Creatures can cross the bridge at half speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check or at full speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. The DC assumes a creature is using both hands to assist in navigating the rope bridge; the DC increases by 5 if a creature uses only one hand to steady itself and by 10 if the creature does not use its hands. A failed Acrobatics check results in failure to progress across the rope bridge; creatures that fail by 5 or more fall.\n*   **Rope Hammock**: the rope knits itself into a stationary hammock suspended in midair. The hammock can be suspended at a height of 5 feet plus 5 feet per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 30 feet), with a rope ladder (see below) leading up to a platform of 1 5-foot square per caster level, and at least one such square must be adjacent to the square containing the vertical rope ladder. As a move action, the caster can command the rope ladder to withdraw into the hammock. When the ladder is withdrawn, the rope hammock blends in with its surroundings and muffles sounds and smells from creatures resting on it that are taking no violent actions; noticing the rope hammock requires a successful DC 20 Perception check or Survival check, even for creatures with scent. This does not apply if the creatures in the hammock attack or move more than half speed. The hammock provides a +2 cover bonus to AC against attacks from beneath it.\n*   **Rope Ladder**: the rope knots itself and hangs suspended in midair, perpendicular to the ground, stretching up to 10 feet vertically per caster level you have (maximum 100 feet). Climbing the rope ladder requires a successful DC 5 Climb check, or DC 0 if there is a wall adjacent to it you can brace it against.\n*   **Trip Line**: the rope stretches into a tangled mass that fills one 5-foot square per caster level you have (maximum 10 squares), all of which must be contiguous (including diagonally). Any creature entering a square with this trip line must succeed at an Acrobatics check (DC = 10 if moving at half speed, DC = 15 if moving at full speed, and DC = 20 if running or charging). On a failed check, the creature’s movement stops when it enters the square; a creature that fails by 5 or more falls prone. A creature larger than Medium gains a +2 bonus on its Acrobatics check for every size category larger than Medium it is."

When someone who heard the rumor directly from you and repeated the rumor is within your range, they glow silver to your sight, though this glow doesn’t occur if the creature is in disguise (unless it was in the same disguise at the time of casting). You can choose to follow the rumor by selecting any such creature in range, at which point the creatures who heard the rumor from you no longer glow silver, and now the creatures who heard the rumor from your chosen creature glow silver instead. You can follow the rumor’s path until you reach a creature that heard the rumor but didn’t repeat it (or repeated it incorrectly). The glow identifies only creatures who heard the same information you conveyed. Minor cosmetic changes in the rumor don’t interrupt the chain, but when the rumor no longer resembles the information you imparted, the trail stops and the spell ends.\n\nYou can instead use this spell to trace a rumor back to its source once you hear it. In this case, you repeat the rumor as you heard it for the spell’s verbal component. The person who told you the rumor can attempt a Will save to end the effect. Failure indicates the silver glow leads to the individual that told her. This process continues each time you locate the next individual spreading the same information. Each individual attempts the save until one of them succeeds (in which case the spell ends and you can’t attempt to trace this particular rumor again) or you trace the rumor to its original source. As with the other application of the spell, tracing a rumor back fails to cause a creature to glow if it is in disguise, unless it was in the same disguise at the time of speaking the rumor."

You determine the spell’s effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient’s body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp. The inscribed rune lasts for 24 hours or until the spell is activated. Unless otherwise noted, the creature upon which the rune of rule has been inscribed can activate it at any time as a swift action. If the spell effect isn’t used, all markings associated with the rune disappear and the effect fades. You can never place the spell upon yourself-it must be bestowed on someone else. The seven runes of rule, along with their specific effects when the user activates them, are listed below. A creature can bear only one rune of rule at a time.\n\n**Charity**: A creature bearing this mark gains a +5 insight bonus on a single attack roll or skill check attempted at the request of another creature, provided the creature bearing this mark does not gain any immediate benefit or reward for making the roll or attempting the check.\n\n**Generosity**: A creature bearing the rune of generosity can activate it as an immediate action, but it must do so as another creature within 30 feet activates a consumable magic item such as a potion or scroll that was given to it at some point within the last 24 hours by the creature bearing the rune. When the rune is activated, the effects of the consumable magic item resolve at a caster level that is 2 higher than the item’s actual caster level.\n\n**Humility**: When a creature activates the rune of humility, it does not provoke attacks of opportunity for 1 round.\n\n**Kindness**: A creature must be using the aid another action or casting a healing spell in order to activate a rune of kindness. If the creature activates the rune while using the aid another action, the bonus imparted on a success increases to +5. If the creature instead activates the rune while casting a healing spell, the effective caster level of the spell increases by 2.\n\n**Love**: When a creature activates the rune of love as he casts a spell with the charm descriptor, the save DC of that spell increases by 1. Alternatively, a creature can activate the rune of love after he rolls damage for a weapon or spell attack, causing the damage dealt to become nonlethal damage.\n\n**Temperance**: A creature bearing the rune of temperance can activate it as an immediate action immediately upon failing a saving throw against a poison, disease, drug, or similar effect. The creature can immediately attempt a second saving throw against the effect and can use the result of that second saving throw as the actual result.\n\n**Zeal**: A creature that activates the rune of zeal gains a +3 bonus on Will saves, and the save DCs of all language-dependent effects created by the creature increase by 1; these effects last for 1 round."

It still can’t take any actions besides communicating but can use feats and skills related to speaking (such as Bluff and Diplomacy).\n\nAfter 1 week of the object being out of your presence, the creature can create a number of haunts with a total CR (that is, the CR of the encounter with all of the haunts at once) equaling 1/4 the creature’s Hit Dice. These haunts are centered on the object.\n\nThe creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point.\n\nAfter 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to 1/2 its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object.\n\nAfter 1 year of being out of your presence, in addition to the above abilities, the creature can attempt to possess any living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that touches the object, as per possession.

You must free the creature and impose another sacramental seal if you want to restrict its abilities again.\n\nIf the object is placed in the stewardship of creatures or a location belonging to your faith, it still counts as being out of your presence but it takes ten times longer for the creature to manifest the above abilities (it would take 10 weeks for it to manifest the ability to create haunts, for example)."

Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target—few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.\n\nThe table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering’s equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of [planar ally](/spells/planar-ally). Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of [miracle](/spells/miracle) or [wish](/spells/wish). The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature’s choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.\n\nYou cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain 2 permanent negative levels to gain a +16 bonus, nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 Hit Dice worth of creatures to pay for a 10-HD creature’s service.\n\n| Type | Sacrifice | Typical Bonus | GP Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Treasures | 100 gp/HD of Target | +1 | Equal |\n| Lives | 1 living creature with HD equal to target | +2 | 200 gp/HD |\n| Body/Mind | Permanent -1 ability drain | +4 | 500 gp/point drained |\n| Morals | Alignment shifts one step toward target’s | +6 | 1,000 gp/step |\n| Soul | One permanent negative level | +8 | 2,500 gp |"

The spell provides a snapshot of the topography and creature locations when cast; it doesn’t adjust for changes that occur during the duration. The table shows the land surrounding itself up to a 1-mile radius from the surface. The sand table does not reveal invisible or incorporeal creatures, nor does it include creatures that are underground, indoors, submerged below the surface of water, below a tree line or other source of cover from above, or flying above 1,000 feet in the air. Those looking at the table can spot Small and larger creatures that are using Stealth to hide, but they take a –10 penalty on their Perception checks because of the size of the models.\n\nOnce the spell has been cast, if anything moves or shakes the surface upon which it was placed, the spell ends instantly."

Short-duration wind effects such as [gust of wind](/spells/gust-of-wind) create sandstorms with the same area and duration as the spell, plus an identical duration after the spell ends.\n\nAfter 1 month, the soil in an area affected by sea of dust has virtually disintegrated.

Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.\n\nThe chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) The chests are non-magical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.\n\nTo hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, even with a _wish_ spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.\n\nLiving things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive."

You can target that creature with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than seeds of influence as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the modified spell doesn’t take longer to cast and doesn’t use a higher-level spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast, seeds of influence ends for that target. A creature can be subject to only one seeds of influence spell at a time; later castings of seeds of influence remove any previous casting."

While your senses are in the severed head, your body is blind and deaf until you spend a free action to shift your senses back to your own body.\n\nWhen you create the head, you can imprint it with a single triggering condition, similar to [magic mouth](/spells/magic-mouth). Once this triggering condition is set, it can never be changed. If you are within 30 feet of the head, you immediately know if it is triggered (if you have multiple active sentry skulls, you also know which one was triggered). This wakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb your concentration. For example, you could have a sentry skull alert you if any humanoid comes into view, if a particular rival approaches, if your guard animal is killed, and so on, as long as it occurs where the severed head can see it.\n\nThis spell does not give the head any ability to speak, think, or take any kind of action other than to turn itself, though it is a suitable target for other spells such as [magic mouth](/spells/magic-mouth)."

The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake’s strike. If it succeeds, the _sepia snake_ dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed.\n\nWhile trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.\n\nThe hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and [detect magic](/spells/detect-magic) reveals only that the entire text is magical.\n\nA [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic) can remove the sigil. An [erase](/spells/erase) spell destroys the entire page of text.\n\n_Sepia snake sigil_ can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as [secret page](/spells/secret-page)."

When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are manacles or fetters (manacles specifically designed to fit around the ankles). You also summon the restraints’ key to your person; the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 + your caster level + the modifier of your primary casting ability score. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell’s casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell’s DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target’s limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together.\n\nAs you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per [dimensional anchor](/spells/dimensional-anchor) with a duration of 1 minute per caster level. If you are 18th level or higher and use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, the restraints’ hardness increases to 30, they have 60 hit points, and they can’t be broken with a successful Strength check. (The emerald must be worth at least 2,000 gp if you also wish to use the [dimensional anchor](/spells/dimensional-anchor) effect described earlier.)\n\nIf you cast this spell before the duration of a previous casting has lapsed, you can create a new set of restraints or reset the previous spell’s duration. If you used an expensive material component during a previous casting, you must again use a component when creating new restraints or resetting the duration if you wish to maintain the special effect. You do not need to touch these previously created shackles to renew their duration, though you must be on the same plane as the shackles. When this spell ends, the restraints disappear, and any ongoing effects created by the spell end."

When shadow invasion is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton will be summoned under the caster’s command (as per [summon monster V](/spells/summon-monster)). This chance is 5% for every full round that shadow invasion was active. If the caster level of shadow invasion is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutor kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of shadow invasion would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors."

Your target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects you generate, and you gain a +4 bonus on caster level checks you attempt to overcome the target’s spell resistance.\n\n**Weakness** grants you knowledge of physical vulnerabilities your target has, as well as information about the target’s damage reduction, immunities, and other defensive abilities.

You can only have one target affected by shadow memory at any one time; if you cast this spell a second time while a previous casting is still active, the effects of the new spell replace the effects of the old one."

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.\n\nIn the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.\n\nBecause of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can’t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It’s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 x 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 x 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).\n\n_Shadow walk_ can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.\n\nAny creatures touched by you when _shadow walk_ is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.\n\nThey may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful."

The entrance to the extradimensional space remains visible as an area that is darker than the ambient illumination.\n\nSpells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 5-foot-by-5-foot door or window were centered on the affected surface. The window is invisible (though it is within the shadowed entrance to the spell, which is visible), and even creatures that can see the window from the outside can’t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space is ejected when the spell ends. Only one creature may enter or exit the extradimensional space at a time.\n\nThe entrance is only open when the area around it is in dim light.

If this occurs, the creatures appear on the Shadow Plane 1d10 miles in a random direction from their corresponding location on the Material Plane. The spell has no effect if cast on a plane that is not adjacent to the Shadow Plane.\n\nBecause the extradimensional space is adjacent to the Shadow Plane, any [shadow walk](/spells/shadow-walk) spell or similar effect that allows travel to the Shadow Plane is more accurate, reducing the distance creatures arrive off-target by half."

The target doesn’t distinguish between magical and non-magical items when removing them.

When determining randomly, don’t include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don’t include items that take more than one move action to remove. Though creatures can’t have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove. If a target is wearing clothing that doesn’t fit in any of those slots, such as breeches or a quiver, add it to the list of possibilities at the GM’s discretion.\n\nThe target regards the discarded items with revulsion, and if forced to touch such an item (such as with a melee or ranged touch attack using the item as an improvised weapon), the target becomes sickened for 1d3 rounds.

The target must have the physical capacity to articulate sounds, make gestures, or engage in whatever other method speakers of the language use to communicate with each other in order to actually converse. If the target lacks the mental capacity to grasp an actual language, it still gains enough knowledge to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached in the language (whether written or spoken). However, since this spell does not endow the target with greater reasoning capacity, merely a temporarily enhanced vocabulary, the person offering up instructions to non-sentient creatures must take care to remove any ambiguity or guesswork.\n\nSimilarly, this spell does not affect the basic nature of the target, or its disposition toward you or anyone else, so convincing it to actually carry out these instructions could require negotiation, threats, or outright bribery."

Your skin can take any actions you could normally take in your own body (such as to fight or cast spells).\n\nWhen your skin leaves your body, your body’s hit points drop to 0. Your body cannot heal damage naturally while you have no skin, nor do spells that cure hit point damage work on your body; only regeneration (from a [regenerate](/spells/regenerate) spell, _ring of regeneration_, the regeneration monster ability, or any other effect that can regrow missing limbs) or [heal](/spells/heal) can regrow your skin and allow you to heal above 0 hit points.\n\nIf your body is regenerated before your skin returns to it, the skin dies and your consciousness returns automatically to your body. Your skin can be preserved with [gentle repose](/spells/gentle-repose) and is suitable for any purpose that requires some of your flesh (such as a [resurrection](/spells/resurrection) spell) or any magic or ritual that requires a creature’s skin.\n\nWhen your skin returns to your body, you regain hit points equal to your skin’s remaining hit points. If the spell ends before you reunite with your skin or if your skin is killed while you are in your body, you remain helpless and at 0 hit points until your full body is restored to you (requiring powerful magic, as described above). If your body dies while you are possessing your skin, you die when the spell ends, regardless of how many hit points the skin has left. If your body or skin is slain with your consciousness in it, the spell ends and you are instantly killed.\n\nThis spell leaves long scars on your skin where it split apart, although these fade normally with the use of healing magic."

The suggested activity must not cause the target to directly harm itself or others, but it doesn’t need to be reasonable. For example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or poison its ally’s rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de grace action against a sleeping ally. Instructions that cause direct harm prompt the target to awaken just prior to performing the action and the target experiences a vague memory of what it was supposed to do.\n\nThe target moves at its speed, but isn’t capable of running or moving at a higher rate of speed. It moves in dark conditions as if it had darkvision and can perform most simple and skill-based actions, but it can’t engage in combat, spellcasting, or actions that require significant cognitive awareness (like making complex decisions, solving puzzles, or using complicated magic items). If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking, it must attempt a new saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell ends and the creature awakens. When the target completes the suggested course of activity, or when the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and returns to where it was sleeping and must be awoken normally.

The creature’s skin regrows rapidly—once its Constitution damage is fully healed, its skin becomes intact once again and the penalties end."

One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cord-like object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.\n\nThe snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points.

A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can’t run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can’t run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.\n\nWhile this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls (treat as a cave-in with no bury zone, see Environment).\n\nA moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle.

The contract may be as simple as allowing the target one casting of each of the imbued spells (as per imbue with spell ability), or may continue for multiple days or even indefinitely, with the target regaining use of the imbued spells when you next prepare your own spells. You may include any proviso you see ft, such as requiring the target to pray to Asmodeus each morning, or restricting the target to only casting the imbued spells on himself. If the target does not agree to all the conditions in the contract, this spell fails when cast. The contract (and this spell) automatically expires if you or the target dies. While the contract remains in effect, you gain a profane bonus to your Armor Class, saving throws, and checks equal to the highest- level spell you have imbued.\n\nOnce you cast this spell, you cannot prepare a new 5th-level spell to replace it until the contract expires. If the number of 5th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active lesser spellcasting contract spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.\n\nUnlike imbue with spell ability, how the target uses the spell has no refection on your alignment or relationship with Asmodeus; the Prince of Darkness accepts that allowing another access to his magic for good may benefit his plans in the long run. Note that unlike imbue with spell ability, you cannot dismiss this spell; you must abide by the contract’s termination clause (though the contract may include a proviso for at-will nullification by either or both parties). This spell cannot be combined with imbue with spell ability or similar spells to give a target more spells than the limit.\n\nExample: You cast this spell on your 5 HD fighter cohort after negotiating an appropriate contract, imbuing him with the ability to cast cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, and shield of faith once per day for 1 month. If he casts any of these spells, he recovers them when you prepare your spells. Until the contract ends, your 5th-level spell slot used to cast this spell remains expended and cannot be filled with a new spell. Because you imbued your cohort with a 2nd-level spell, you gain a +2 profane bonus to attacks, saves, and checks while the contract remains in effect."

        "description": "A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.\n\nEach round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round’s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the _spiritual weapon_ is a ranged weapon, use the spell’s range, not the weapon’s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.\n\nA _spiritual weapon_ cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic), [disintegrate](/spells/disintegrate), a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. A _spiritual weapon_‘s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).\n\nIf an attacked creature has Spell Resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that Spell Resistance the first time the _spiritual weapon_ strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is [dispelled](/spells/dispel-magic). If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.\n\nThe weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity’s own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a _spiritual weapon_ of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows:\n\n*   chaos (battleaxe)\n*   evil (light flail)\n*   good (warhammer)\n*   law (longsword)"

As a swift action, you may grant one of your natural or manufactured weapons the flaming special ability for 1 round. If you have the fire subtype, your weapon instead gains the flaming burst special ability. If the weapon leaves your hand for any reason, it loses the flaming (or flaming burst) special ability until you spend a swift action to activate it again. You can only have stoke the inner fire active on one weapon at a time, and spending a swift action to imbue a second weapon with the spell’s power immediately ends its effect on the first weapon.\n\nThe spell also builds a wall of searing heat between your armor and your flesh. Anyone striking you with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1 point of fire damage. A creature that grapples you or is grappled by you takes 1 point of fire damage each round the grapple persists. If you have the fire subtype, these damage values increase to 1d6 points of fire damage each. Removing your armor causes this wall of heat to dissipate and ends these effects.\n\n ![](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257295/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257295&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=4GSFU74S3RNG7I7N) ![](http://d20pfsrd.opengamingnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/irthttpwwwd20pfs-20amplas2ampo-2ampa-260-2257295-2)\n\nGet this book AND support this site!"

You trap within the gem an image of everything visible within a 30-foot cone measured from the gem, in a direction of your choice. Alternatively, you can capture a less detailed image of a single object within sight. Once the casting is complete, the gem turns opaque, and the image inside cannot be seen. The stolen image remains within the gem until released or dispelled.\n\nTo release an image, you touch a gem holding _stolen light_ as a standard action and speak a command word chosen at the time of casting. For 1 minute per caster level, the image stored within the gem becomes visible. Details can be made out as clearly as they could be perceived at the time of casting. Darkvision is of no use for making out details in a stolen image, though low-light vision or other exceptional visual talents may reveal information the caster did not see. Light sources brighter than bright light are reduced to bright light in the stolen image. Once the image has been released, it cannot again be recovered from the gem.\n\n_Stolen light_ can be made permanent with the [permanency](/spells/permanency) spell by a caster of 10th level for a cost of 5,000 gp.

Each round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your turn.\n\n**2nd Round**: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage (no save).\n\n**3rd Round**: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed at the same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. A creature struck can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.\n\n**4th Round**: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save).\n\n**5th through 10th Rounds**: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters.\n\nRanged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the _storm of vengeance_‘s save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.\n\n### By the way…\n\nThe effects created by this spell do not move with a ship and this spell does not start a fire on a ship."

As long as you remain within the storm, you can concentrate on it for 1 minute to determine whether or not other living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher are caught in the storm within 400 feet of you. Due to the nature of the spell, you do not need to attempt concentration checks against violent wind or storms when casting the spell, but other elements that might disrupt spellcasting require checks as normal. While the spell is in effect, you no longer need to attempt concentration checks as a result of wind or storms for spells you cast or concentrate on.\n\nOnce you’ve sensed creatures with this spell by concentrating for 1 minute, you can continue concentrating to learn more. After you concentrate for 1 additional round, the spell reveals to you via winds and rain the presence of any Small or larger living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher within 400 feet of you. After 2 consecutive rounds of concentration, you learn the approximate distance to the detected life forms from your current location. After 3 rounds of concentration, the rain and winds allow you to determine the approximate direction of each life form. Once you’ve concentrated in this way for 3 rounds, you gain a bonus equal to half your caster level on your next initiative check during the spell’s duration."

        "description": "You cause a large tree to grow in the 5-foot square you touch. The tree has 1 foot of thickness for every 4 caster levels you have, and it can grow to any height you designate, up to 5 feet high per caster level you have. If there is a ceiling or other barrier overhead, the maximum height of the tree cannot exceed the space available. At any point along the tree’s height, you can create a sturdy wooden building that fills one 10-foot cube for every 4 caster levels you have. All portions of the structure must be adjacent to the trunk of the tree (or can have the tree trunk extend up through their spaces), but otherwise these cubes need not be contiguous. If you place the cubes so that they are contiguous, the buildings merge together, complete with ladders connecting different vertical levels. The fort is magically supported, but if the tree it is attached to is destroyed, the structure is destroyed as well (the tree has hardness 5 and 20 hp per caster level you have).\n\nEach building you create has shuttered arrow slits on its walls and in the floor, granting those within the structure improved cover against attacks from outside while the arrow slits are open and total cover when they are closed. Each cube within the fort is equivalent to a [secure shelter](/spells/secure-shelter), other than the size and its wooded construction material (hardness 5). When you cast sturdy tree fort, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. Designated creatures gain a +10 bonus on Climb checks and are not denied their Dexterity bonuses while climbing on the fort’s structure, as they find handholds and stable footholds easily on the tree and its buildings.\n\nYou cannot cast this spell in an area of worked stone, though you can cast it in natural surroundings that would not normally support the growth of a large tree, such as a cavern, desert, or glacier. If you cast this spell in a forest, jungle, or similar heavily treed terrain, the fort is camouflaged as long as its doors and windows remain closed (or even if they are open, as long as those within remain quiet and take no violent actions), requiring a successful DC 25 Perception check or Survival check to notice its presence."

You alter your perceptions to become convinced the target is an illusion.\n\nFor you, the target becomes transparent and does not create sound or smell. Until the spell ends, you can move through the target unimpeded and the target can move through you. The target’s nonmagical attacks cannot harm you, and the target’s magical attacks deal half damage to you. The target’s non-damaging magical abilities have a 50% chance not to affect you, and you are immune to all its sonic, language-dependent, and scent\\-based attacks. However, your attacks deal no damage to the target, and your magical abilities do not affect the target at all. You or the target can affect each other normally through intermediaries. For instance, while the target would be immune to the direct effects of your [earthquake](/spells/earthquake) spell, if the spell caused a room’s ceiling to collapse, the target would not be immune to the effects of the collapse.\n\n ![](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257856/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257856&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=KXZRYKU2EBIOL4LF) \n\n![](http://d20pfsrd.opengamingnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/irthttpwwwd20pfs-20amplas2ampo-2ampa-260-2257856-2)\n\nGet this book AND support this site!"

For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet. The ship’s pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell’s effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel’s normal movement.\n\nDespite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions.\n\nThe spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won’t accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell’s duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition. This spell has no effect if cast upon a ship in water that cannot cover the vessel entirely.\n\nAlthough largely beneficial, this spell can be cast on a ship whose pilot does not want to submerge her vessel. The ship itself uses its Will saving throw to resist this effect."

If the target fails, he immediately begins to suffocate. On the target’s next turn, he falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the target drops to -1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the target dies. Each round, the target can delay that round’s effects from occurring by making a successful Fortitude save, but the spell continues for 3 rounds, and each time a target fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step further along the track to suffocation. This spell only affects living creatures that must breathe. It is impossible to defeat the effects of this spell by simply holding one’s breath-if the victim fails the initial Saving Throw, the air in his lungs is extracted."

It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on **Table: Summon Monster**. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\n\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as [wish](/spells/wish)).\n\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on **Table: Summon Monster** marked with an “\\*” are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an “\\*” always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell’s type match your alignment.\n\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\n\nSummon Monster II\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; **Subdomain** dark tapestry 2; **Elemental School** air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list.\n\nSummon Monster III\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list.\n\nSummon Monster IV\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; **Elemental School** air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster V\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner/ unchained summoner 4, witch 5; **Domain** darkness 5; **Subdomain** dark tapestry 5; **Elemental School** air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster VI\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; **Elemental School** air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster VII\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; **Bloodline** aquatic 7; **Elemental School** air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster VIII\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8; **Elemental School** air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster IX\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; **Domain** chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; **Bloodline** abyssal 9\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\n### Alternative Summoning Options\n\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\n\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use. The **Source** column indicates which Adventure Path or specific book included that creature as an alternative summoning option.\n\n### Applicable Feats\n\nThere are a few feats which have special effects on the summon monster spells.\n\n*   If the caster is good-aligned he may choose the Summon Good Monster feat.\n*   If the caster is neutral-aligned he may choose the Summon Neutral Monster feat.\n*   If the caster is evil-aligned he may choose the Summon Evil Monster feat.\n\nThese feats include custom summoning lists and are fully detailed in the feats section of this site."

Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as [wish](/spells/wish)).\n\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on **Table: Summon Monster** marked with an “\\*” are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an “\\*” always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell’s type match your alignment.\n\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\n\nSummon Monster II\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; **Subdomain** dark tapestry 2; **Elemental School** air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list.\n\nSummon Monster III\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list.\n\nSummon Monster IV\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; **Elemental School** air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster V\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner/ unchained summoner 4, witch 5; **Domain** darkness 5; **Subdomain** dark tapestry 5; **Elemental School** air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster VI\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; **Elemental School** air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster VII\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; **Bloodline** aquatic 7; **Elemental School** air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster VIII\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8; **Elemental School** air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\nSummon Monster IX\n\n**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; **Domain** chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; **Bloodline** abyssal 9\n\nThis spell functions like _summon monster I_, except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\n\n### Alternative Summoning Options\n\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\n\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

The **Source** column indicates which Adventure Path or specific book included that creature as an alternative summoning option.\n\n### Applicable Feats\n\nThere are a few feats which have special effects on the summon monster spells.\n\n*   If the caster is good-aligned he may choose the Summon Good Monster feat.\n*   If the caster is neutral-aligned he may choose the Summon Neutral Monster feat.\n*   If the caster is evil-aligned he may choose the Summon Evil Monster feat.\n\nThese feats include custom summoning lists and are fully detailed in the feats section of this site."

The ship comes with all equipment necessary for sailing or rowing the ship but provides no crew or cargo.

The ship displaces all water and Medium or smaller aquatic animals within its space when it appears, but the location must be otherwise unoccupied at the time of casting the spell. You can cast this spell again to extend the duration of the conjured ship, replacing the remaining duration with the new spell’s duration.

While in this form, you cannot use any of your own abilities or take any actions other than controlling the swarms.\n\nEach time you cast this spell you get a total allotment of levels equal to your caster level and any swarm you choose to create costs one or more of those levels. You can “spend” your allotment of levels to create any combination of swarms so long as their total does not exceed your caster level.\n\n| Number of Levels | Swarm Type(s) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2 caster levels | Spider swarm |\n| 4 caster levels | Rat swarm |\n| 6 caster levels | Crab swarm, wasp swarm |\n| 8 caster levels | Centipede swarm, leech swarm |\n| 10 caster levels | Army ant swarm |\n\nOnce you create these swarms they remain in existence until destroyed or you order them to return to your body. When all swarms have returned to your body or are destroyed, your flesh wraps itself back around your bones and you regain the ability to act normally. If your bones are not where you left them you must first locate them in order to regain access to your body. You always know if your bones are destroyed and your consciousness remains in control of the swarms until they too are destroyed (and your die). If you can use the swarms to get help and arrange for someone to repair your bones (using anything that would normally restore you to life), at which point you can return the swarms to your body."

        "description": "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a _symbol of death_ kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The _symbol of death_ affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the _symbol of death_ is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.\n\nUntil it is triggered, the _symbol of death_ is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a _symbol of death_ must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the _symbol of death_ ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the _symbol of death_ works normally.\n\nAs a default, a _symbol of death_ is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a _symbol of death’s_ triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n\nIn this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a _symbol of death_ to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can’t use a _symbol of death_ offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the _symbol of death_ is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a _symbol of death_ cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\n\nYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a _symbol of death_ can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don’t qualify.\n\nWhen scribing a _symbol of death_, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol’s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\n\nYou also can attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of death_, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a _symbol of death_ cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own _symbols of death_, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\n\nRead magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol’s spell level). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\n\nA _symbol of death_ can be removed by a successful [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic) targeted solely on the rune. An [erase](/spells/erase) spell has no effect on a _symbol of death_. Destruction of the surface where a _symbol of death_ is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it."

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.\n\n**Sustained Force**: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.\n\nAn object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.\n\n**Combat Maneuver**: Alternatively, once per round, you can use _telekinesis_ to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.\n\n**Violent Thrust**: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).\n\nYou must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.\n\nCreatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.\n\nIf a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points)."

You can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell’s duration.\n\nThe sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.\n\nYou can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it."

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is Spell Resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and Spell Resistance.\n\nYou must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\n\n| Familiarity | On Target | Off Target | Similar Area | Mishap |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Very familiar | 01–97 | 98–99 | 100 | — |\n| Studied carefully | 01–94 | 95–97 | 98–99 | 100 |\n| Seen casually | 01–88 | 89–94 | 95–98 | 99–100 |\n| Viewed once | 01–76 | 77–88 | 89–96 | 97–100 |\n| False destination | — | — | 81–92 | 93–100 |\n\nTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the following table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\n\n_Familiarity_: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you’ve been there often. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as [scrying](/spells/scrying).\n\n“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\n\n_On Target_: You appear where you want to be.\n\n_Off Target_: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\n\n_Similar Area_: You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.\n\n_Mishap_: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll."

If you cast this spell and do not or cannot immediately follow the instructions described above, this spell has no effect.\n\nFor example, after casting this spell, a wizard could cast [temporal stasis](/spells/temporal-stasis) on a demon and [fireball](/spells/fireball) on a group of orcs. Seeing that the demon succeeds at its saving throw against [temporal stasis](/spells/temporal-stasis) and that the [fireball](/spells/fireball) kills many orcs, the wizard chooses the [fireball](/spells/fireball) to take effect. The [temporal stasis](/spells/temporal-stasis) is treated as if it had not been cast, and its spell slot and costly material component are not expended.\n\nCasting this spell more than once in a single day is risky. On the second and subsequent casting in a 24-hour period, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or be exposed to a crippling array of possibilities and paradoxes that leave you confused for 24 hours. Whenever this [confusion](/spells/confusion) would cause you to attack the nearest creature, you instead expend your highest-level remaining prepared spell or spell slot, if any, with no effect."

As a standard action while you are within range of the beacon before the spell’s duration expires, you can discharge the spell to transport yourself back to the marked location and restore yourself to the condition you were in when you cast the spell; this does not restore any expended items, charges, or spells you may have used during that time. This does not reverse effects for anyone else, and to bystanders it appears as though you teleported to the beacon location and regained conditions you had when the beacon was set. Temporal regression strains your body; when the spell is discharged, you gain 1 temporary negative level for every 2 rounds that passed since you cast the spell. These negative levels disappear after 24 hours.\n\nYou can discharge the spell to transport yourself back to your beacon as an immediate action instead of a standard action, but doing so utterly and entirely consumes the spell’s focus."

If the save or Spell Resistance is successful, the gem shatters.\n\n**Trigger Object**: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A [sympathy](/spells/sympathy) spell can also be placed on the trigger object.

This trip attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though you do provoke one for casting the spell), nor are you knocked prone if you fail the check by 10 or more. Unlike with a regular trip attack, you can trip any creature touching the ground, regardless of size. Improved Trip does not affect this spell in any way. Though the earthquake is small and focused on the ground, if the area is particularly unstable, the spell might cause items to topple, stones to shake loose from the walls or ceiling, and so on at the GM’s discretion."

If this CMB check defeats a creature’s CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave’s CMB check-if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half ) and continues being carried along by the wave.\n\nObjects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave’s journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space-if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave.

In addition, if the target is denied a Dexterity bonus to AC or the knife flanks the target, the knife can make sneak attacks as a rogue, inflicting an extra 1d6 points of force damage per four caster levels on a successful attack.\n\nA _twilight knife_ cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but [dispel magic](/spells/dispel-magic), [disintegrate](/spells/disintegrate), _a sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. A _twilight knife_‘s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object) plus your Dexterity modifier.\n\nIf an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the _twilight knife_ strikes it. If the knife is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell."

You are able to shift your consciousness from one body to the other once each round as a free action. This shift takes place either immediately before your turn or immediately after it, but not during the round. You may act normally in the body you inhabit. Your other self is treated as though dazed, except it may take a single move action each round during your turn. Your twin cannot speak while you are in your other body, and cannot flank, make attacks of opportunity, or otherwise threaten enemies.\n\nBoth you and your twin have the same statistics and start with the number of hit points you had when you ingested the extract. Once you have split, these hit points are tracked separately. Any spells, extracts, or magical effects (such as from potions) that were active when you ingested the extract are active for both you and your twin. If any such effects expire, are dispelled, dismissed, or otherwise used or ended, they end for both of you. Extracts or spells cast after you split affect you and your twin as though you were two separate targets. Your equipment is linked between your two selves, and if an item on one is consumed or destroyed, its duplicate is used up or destroyed as well.\n\nThe body you do not inhabit crumbles into dust when the extract’s duration expires or is dismissed. If the body you inhabit is destroyed, you immediately shift to your surviving self and the extract immediately ends. The body you left behind crumbles into dust, and you are stunned until the start of your next turn. If the body you do not inhabit is destroyed, the extract also ends immediately, but you suffer no ill effects.\n\nYou have no special ability to sense what your second body is experiencing, though you immediately know if it has been destroyed. You may switch between bodies at any distance on the same plane. If your bodies cross into separate planes (including through the use of [teleport](/spells/teleport) or [blink](/spells/blink)), the body you inhabit survives, while your other body is destroyed."

This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under which you wish the target to take this action, also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words cause the spell to fail. _Unconscious agenda_ cannot compel a target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast.\n\nIf the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he wishes until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell [dominate person](/spells/dominate-person). (If the compelled action is against the victim’s nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus against the spell to end its effects.) For the next hour, the target acts as you dictated, doing all he can to fulfill your command. If, at the end of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. Once the course of action is completed, the spell ends. The target has full memory of acts performed during this hour.\n\nIt’s difficult to detect an _unconscious agenda_ before the spell is triggered.

One viper attacks the target of the direct hit, and the other vipers attack up to three creatures that take damage from the splash damage. The vipers make melee touch attacks (using your base attack bonus + Intelligence modifier) and on a hit deal 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier damage, and the target is poisoned as if by a venomous snake.

        "description": "This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A _wall of ice_ cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a _wall of ice_, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a _wall of ice_ creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.\n\n**Ice Plane**: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a _wall of ice_ 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.\n\nEach 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.\n\nEven when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).\n\n**Hemisphere**: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The _hemisphere_ is as hard to break through as the _ice plane_ form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach."

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.\n\nA _wall of iron_ is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.\n\nIf you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.\n\nLike any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. Iron created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects and cannot be sold."

A _wall of lava_‘s maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a _wall of lava_ can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall’s overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a _wall of lava_, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).\n\nA creature can move through a _wall of lava_ as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a _wall of lava_ inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A _wall of lava_ also radiates heat as if it were a _wall of fire_, although the heat from a _wall of lava_ radiates from both sides.\n\nOnce per round as a move action, you can direct the _wall of lava_ to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall’s overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a _wall of lava_ from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.\n\nAll damage inflicted by physical contact with a _wall of lava_ continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round)."

The wall appears to have no actual substance and does not physically obstruct or impede anything attempting to move through it. However, the wall exerts a powerful anti-magical effect. Any magic item or magical spell or effect of your caster level or lower that passes through the wall is suppressed for 1 round per level.\n\nSpells or effects with durations expire normally, even while thus suppressed. A spell or effect with a duration greater than that of the suppression effect resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends. The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a creature’s ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration.\n\nThe wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through the wall, but it does not block line of sight. Magic items or spell effects with a higher caster level than yours are unaffected by the _wall of suppression_. The wall does not affect artifacts, anything stemming from the direct action of a deity, or similarly powerful sorts of magic."

        "description": "A _wall of thorns_ spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human’s finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a _wall of thorns_ takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature’s AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)\n\nYou can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.\n\nCreatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.\n\nAny creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a _wall of thorns_ at normal speed without taking damage.\n\nA _wall of thorns_ can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes."

The caster of the spell can select any one of the following four effects, but can change the effect as a standard action that reduces the total remaining duration by 1 hour.\n\n_Spring_: The target is wrapped in light vines, culminating in a crown of bright, beautiful flowers. While the spell remains in effect, the target is immune to bleed effects and regains 1 hit point per round whenever below 0 hit points, as long as the target is still alive. This stabilizes the target. For each hit point restored in this way, the spell’s total remaining duration is reduced by 1 hour.\n\n_Summer_: The target is surrounded by tiny motes of light. While the spell remains in effect, the target’s base speed increases 10 feet. The target may instead increase its base speed by 30 feet for 1 round by reducing the spell’s total remaining duration by 1 hour.\n\n_Fall_: A cloak of autumn leaves appears on the target. While the spell remains in effect, the target gains a +2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves. The target can decide to roll twice on any saving throw against disease or poison and take the higher result by reducing the spell’s total remaining duration by 1 hour.\n\n_Winter_: A flutter of snow and crisp air surrounds the target. While this spell remains in effect, the target automatically succeeds at Acrobatics skill checks made to avoid falling while moving across slick or narrow surfaces. The target can move freely through difficult terrain for 1 round by reducing the spell’s remaining duration by 1 hour. Difficult terrain created by magic affects the target normally."

Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim’s mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subject’s Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2 ounces—enough for one dose or, if bottled, one use as a thrown weapon.\n\nThe fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the _water of maddening_ (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GM’s discretion (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim)."

The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain.

This infestation does not expose the victim to infectious dreams, but it can ultimately result in that creature’s [transformation](/spells/transformation) into one of the seeded. Each time you affect a creature with what grows within in this manner, the remaining duration of what grows within is reduced by 1 round.

The whip takes half again as much damage from spells or effects that affect an area, but since it is considered part of your gear, it takes damage only if you fail a saving throw on a 1 or if it is specifically targeted by an opponent.

Two to five _wish_ spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two _wishes_ for a +2 inherent bonus, three _wishes_ for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. _Note_: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.\n*   Remove injuries and afflictions. A single _wish_ can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same _wish_.\n*   Revive the dead. A _wish_ can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a [resurrection](/spells/resurrection) spell. A _wish_ can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two _wishes_: one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A _wish_ cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from gaining a permanent negative level.\n*   Transport travelers. A _wish_ can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.\n*   Undo misfortune. A _wish_ can undo a single recent event. The _wish_ forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a _wish_ could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on. The re-roll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and Spell Resistance (if any) applies.\n\nYou may try to use a _wish_ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The _wish_ may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM’s discretion.)\n\nDuplicated spells allow saves and Spell Resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).\n\nWhen a _wish_ duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell)."

        "description": "You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave’s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.\n\nWhen you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).\n\nThe wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM’s discretion.\n\nThe wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave’s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.\n\nThe momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).\n\nYou can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate."

Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver. Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the [warding weapon](/spells/warding-weapon) spell. While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice.

A _zone of foul flames_ looks unremarkable to the casual observer, but a Perception check (DC = 20 + the caster’s level) reveals a faint rippling effect in the area, as if of heat distortions in the air.\n\nWhenever a creature casts a spell with the fire descriptor or activates a magical fire effect (as from a magic item or a special attack) while that creature is located in a _zone of foul flames_, that creature takes full fire damage from the effect. If the effect allows a saving throw to reduce the damage, the victim may attempt the same saving throw to reduce the damage. All creatures in a _zone of foul flames_ gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against fire effects, except for those made by a creature attempting to save against fire damage from his own magic. Nonmagical fire in a _zone of foul flames_ burns half as brightly but is otherwise not affected."
