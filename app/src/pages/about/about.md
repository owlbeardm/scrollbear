## Site

I'm trying to make a fast reliable site with all the official spells for Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Handy for desktop or mobile usage with offline access.

### Spells

[Spells](/): complete list of spells with filters (search by name, class, school etc.) and with possibility to add to favorites. More filters are coming!

### Spellbook

[Spellbook](spellbook/characters): interactive list of prepared (or those that cast spontaneously) spells for your character. Spells can be selected from a list for a class, from complete list or from favorites. The number of prepared spells can be easily customized. And there is a history of cast spells for convenience of use.

## Support

The site is completely free. And it will remain so forever.

If you are interested in supporting this project please just share it with you friends or gaming community!
