The moment the spell takes effect, ananimal companionceases to be a class feature, and instead becomes a person—an NPC whoseIntelligencehas increased by 3d6 (potentially making it as smart as or smarter than the caster), and who has an increasedCharismascore and knows at least one spoken language.\nAn adventurer considering awakening hisanimal companionshould keep in mind theawakenspell’s potential drawbacks. Most pointedly, awakenedanimalscan no longer serve as companions, and the character must follow the rules forLeadershipif he wishes to take theanimalas an officialcohort. Further, an intelligentanimalcan be difficult to manage. After awakening,animalsare predisposed to be friendly toward whoever cast the spell— in this case, presumably their masters. Yet if ananimalwas mistreated during its time as a companion, or is treated poorly after its awakening, that friendliness is mixed with a sense of confusion that can last anywhere from a few moments to a few hours as theanimalreconciles the abuse with the great gift it’s been given. Sinceawakenis not acharmor mind-control spell, there’s nothing to prevent awakenedanimalsfrom resenting mistreatment in the same way a normal person of their intelligence level would, and they’re no more inclined to be automatically servile than anyone else. More than one carelessdruidhas found her awakenedanimal companionrefusing to follow instructions, leaving to pursue its own goals, or even seeking vengeance for its former “enslavement.”\nOn the flip side, there are many advantages to awakening ananimal companion. If treated well, an awakenedanimalmay become a valuable member of an adventuring party, adding new perspective to problems and fighting alongside its friends. Awakenedanimalscan also make stealthy and reliable snoops (for who guards her words in front of a dog?), teach adventurers about their native environments, act as guides, and provide a valuable surprise weapon against enemies who think them mere brutes. Druids, in particular, may find awakeninganimal companionsappealing—either because they wish to become true friends with their companions, or because they would value theanimals‘ skills as allies. A deviousdruid, upon witnessing an enemy mistreating its companion, may even castawakenin secret upon the beast, trusting that its natural instincts will make it turn on its oppressor.\nAlthough the personalities of awakenedanimalsare as varied as those of adventurers, augmentedanimalsoften exhibit traits hearkening back to their species. Similarly, certain types ofanimalsmay favor specific classes, battle tactics, or even weapons. The following are examples of some broadanimalgroups’ commonalities.\nAvians: Raptors such aseagles,hawks, andowls—as well as more bizarre fliers—tend to develop aloof, detached personalities, while smaller individuals are often more social and high-strung. Awakened aviananimalskeenly observe the world around them—often understanding it much better than their demure natures might imply— and are adept at inferring others’ desires, motives, and intentions. These intelligent flyers are shrewdly calculating and opportunistic, especially when it comes to ensuring their own survival. Awakened birds can often be found high above a fracas, coldly deciding on the best course of action, and only entering a fray when it’s in their best interest or that of their friends.\nIn combat, aviananimalsenjoy taking opponents by surprise, favoring training asroguesand ninjas, though they may also enjoy abard’sability to soar above the fray and inspire with their songs and majestic screeches. In these capacities, the birds often use their winged stealth to their advantage, taking cover in trees and then striking quickly and silently. Awakened aviananimalsuse their natural weapons, but often with a twist—devious awakened flyers have been known to drop smoke shot, chain shot, and even bombs on unsuspecting enemies.\nLand Mammals (Large): Relishing their brute size and strength, large mammals—such asbison,lions, and rhinoceroses—tend to divide along predator/prey lines. Herbivores tend to be generally docile but easily spooked or enraged, while predators are aggressive and cunning, constantly seeking social dominance. Whether they’re among cowering villagers or in a raiding party, theseanimalslove to tell stories of their physical prowess, and awakened largeanimalstend to be the worst kind of braggadocios.\nIn combat, most largeanimalsgravitate toward brash, volatile tactics, becomingbarbariansorfighterswho enjoy wading into battle before thinking. The exceptions are those hunters like the greatcatsthat rely on stealth and tracking, who are just as likely to becomeroguesorrangersas they are to becomebarbarians. Some large mammals, however, have been known to becomesamurai, replacing their natural affinity for recklessness with precision and discipline.\nLarge mammals recognize the value in using theirnatural weapons, and augment those weapons in any way they can. For arhinoceros, that might mean sharpening its deadly horn, while alionmight tip its claws withpoisonand abisonmight overrun its enemies with spiked chainmail affixed to its chest.\nLand Mammals (Small and Medium): Encompassing perhaps the widest variety of species—including creatures likecheetahs,hyenas,ponies, andweasels—Small and\nMedium mammals tend to adopt mischievous, resourceful personalities when awakened. Used to living in vast ecosystems full of larger predators, these creatures are accustomed to using any advantage they have, banding together with allies or manipulating others to serve their own designs.\nIn battle, theseanimalstend to be smart and savvy, shrewd at observing situations and determining whether it would be most advantageous to fight or run. Thoseanimalswho prefer combat to diplomacy tend to value speed and stealth, thus makingbarbariansandroguesnatural choices, yet the natural curiosity of many smalleranimalsmay also lead them to the study of magic, from wizardry to druidism, which brings their own environments under their control. These creatures tend to be opportunistic, perpetually on the lookout for interesting magic items to help augment their natural abilities.\nAquatic Animals: Often as mysterious as the depths in which they live, ocean dwellers are predisposed to developing deep, philosophical personalities when awakened. The reflective natures ofanimalssuch asgiant squid,whales, anddolphinstypically manifest in one of two ways: they either find majesty in nature or adopt a religion. Once awakened, aquaticanimalsalso tend to be the most creative and artistic group of creatures.\nOf all awakened creatures,aquaticanimalsare the most likely to becomeclericsorpaladins—or cult leaders, for that matter.Aquaticanimalswho eschew religion may instead pursue training asdruidsorbards, or crave the intellectual stimulation of wizardry. In battle,aquaticanimalsprefer to rely on the gifts their personal beliefs provide, casting divine spells or weaving intricate battle songs and spells. As a rule,aquaticanimalseschew combat and fight only when necessary for survival unless an enemy threatens something theanimalholds sacred. Because they so dislike combat,aquaticanimalsrarely alter theirnatural weapons.\nPrimates: Perhaps the mosthumanin their perspectives, augmented primates such asmonkeys,baboons, andgorillastend to have a wide range of personalities. Most are highly social and communicative, though this does not always make them great allies as they form intense attachments, manipulate others, and vie for dominance. Perhaps reflecting their impulsive personalities, primates generally pursue whatever paths seem appropriate in any given moment, and are likely to multiclass, training as anything frombarbarians,fighters,rangers, androgues, to exotic callings such as gunslingers and even magi. Those smaller primates used to traveling quickly through trees make great burglars and sailors, whilegorillasandchimpanzeesmake better mercenaries and berserkers, charging into foes with terrifying force. The weapons primates wield also run the gamut.

For each assistant who castsdominate animal,dominate person, ordominate monster, your caster level for this casting ofbindingincreases by a number equal to a third of that assistant’s level, provided that the spell’s target is appropriate for abindingspell. Since the assistants’ spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of thebindingspell, saving throws andspell resistanceagainst the assistants’ spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initialWillsaving throw and how long thebindinglasts. Allbindingspells are dismissible.\nRegardless of the version ofbindingyou cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don’t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.\nIf you cast any of the first three versions ofbinding(those with limited durations), you may cast additionalbindingspells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell’s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw.

The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form ofbindingis confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.\nSlumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form ofbindingis slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is asleepeffect.\nBound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is asleepeffect.\nHedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.\nMetamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. Thebindingis permanent.

It is merely a post to the Paizo boards by this spell’s original designer meant to clarify his intent and concept when creating this spell. This information is presented merely to help understand how the designer intended it to work. As usual, how it ACTUALLY works is up to the GM.\n“Actually, the basis of this spell is grasping hand, and since that is based upon interposing hand you’re going to see a lot of the same language used from that spell as well.\nSo, it is an auto-attacker, like grasping hand; but what the spell doesn’t say (and perhaps it should) is that designating a new target is a move action. The language concerning moving it within the 30-ft. range was added in editorial review.\nThe intent is the chain does one of the listed combat maneuvers once per round.\nFYI: This was ultimately inspired by Marvel’s Ghost Rider, and a little bit of The Christmas Carol (i.e. Jacob Marley). As a force construct, it’s a way to drag around ghosts, shadows, spectres and the like. Of course, it has more applications than just that, but that’s where the name comes from.”"},{name:"Chains of Fire",school:"evocation",descripters:["fire"],description:""},{name:"Chains of Light",school:"conjuration",subschool:'<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Creation">creation</a>',descripters:["good"],description:""},{name:"Challenge Evil",school:"enchantment",subschool:"compulsion",descripters:['<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>'],description:""},{name:"Chameleon Scales",school:"transmutation;",description:""},{name:"Chameleon Stride",school:"illusion",subschool:"glamer",description:"You fade into the background, and while you are not trulyinvisible, you are hard to pinpoint due to your translucent state.

This spell can’t contact creatures with more than 6Hit Dice. You can’t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar contact entity spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication.\nIf there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don’t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn’t call orsummonthe target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.\nHow creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community.\nUsing this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn’s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells likescrying, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.\nEach type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown onTable: Contact Entity.

First, not all eldritch creatures have a correlating contact spell. Contact spells do not replace or supplantplanar allyorplanar binding, so each contact spell targets an eldritch creature that is not anoutsider. Contact entity spells might be useful for contacting other specific types of creatures that aren’t listed, at the GM’s discretion, and could be adapted for contacting certainoutsiders.\nIt’s recommended that contact entity spells should be discovered in actual play rather than granted to PCs through level advancement. They represent ancient knowledge lost to most spellcasting traditions. Usually found in the form ofscrollsor spell trigger items, an individual contact entity spell comes predetermined to work with a single kind of entity, with the appropriate material component already expended. Copying a spell to aspellbookfrom such ascrolldoesn’t let the caster know how to contact other creatures with the spell. Though the class lists for these spells includes spontaneous casters, this is primarily to let them use the spell if found on ascroll, not to have unfettered access to contact entity as a spell known."},{name:"Contact High",school:"transmutation;",description:"While under the effects of a drug, you can duplicate those effects in others.

You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for analignmentyou do not have.\nBountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have anyanimalsunless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner.

A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits.\nMagic: Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait. If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as “effects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire” or “death spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.” A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.\nMorphic: You may usemove earthat will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell’s normalcasting time, and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes).

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The “walls” and “ceiling” of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane’s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane’s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.\nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane’s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could usemove earthto create a hill orwall of stoneto create a barricade.\nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such asastral projection,etherealness, orplane shift. You are considered “very familiar” with your entire demiplane.\nAs astandard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with aWillsaving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with nosaving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by usinglimited wish, mage’s disjunction,miracle, orwishand making a successful dispel check.\nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two."},{name:"Create Drug",school:"conjuration",subschool:'<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Creation">creation</a>',description:"The caster conjures into being one of the following drugs: aether, flayleaf, opium,keif, scour, shiver, or zerk.

You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can’t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within).\nThe mindscape has normal time, noalignmenttraits, and normal magic.\nYou designate where both you and your subject appear.\nYou don’t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can’t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), You can select it unerringly from among all the creatures.\nYou must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it’s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don’t realize they’re in a mindscape.\nYou must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.\nMore creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the mindscape door spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape, but you’re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time.\nOnly this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.\nAs is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose theirDexteritybonuses to AC.\nIf you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt aWillsave to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it’s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn’t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at itsWillsave, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.\nThis spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0hit pointswhile inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.\nCreate mindscapecan be made permanent with apermanencyspell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated bydispel magic.Dispel magiccan dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before thedispel magiccan take effect.\nYou choose to usedispel magicin one of two ways: atargeted dispelor acounterspell.\nTargeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of thedispel magicspell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell’s caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\nFor example, a 7th-level caster castsdispel magic, targeting a creature affected bystoneskin(caster level 12th) andfly(caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end thestoneskin(which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end thefly(which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, thestoneskinwould have been dispelled, leaving theflyintact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as awall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned bysummon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level (DC = 11 + the item’s caster level). If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as abag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\nCounterspell: Whendispel magicis used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however,dispel magicmay not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.\n\nSchoolabjuration;Levelbard5,cleric/oracle6,druid6,inquisitor6,magus6,occultist5, psychic 6,shaman6,sorcerer/wizard6,spiritualist6,summoner/unchained summoner5,witch6;Domainliberation6;Elemental Schoolvoid6\nEFFECT\nTarget or Areaone spellcaster, creature, or object; or a 20-ft.-radius burst\nDESCRIPTION\nThis spell functions likedispel magic, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures.\nYou choose to usegreater dispel magicin one of three ways: atargeted dispel,area dispel, or acounterspell:\nTargeted Dispel: This functions as a targeteddispel magic, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.\nAdditionally,greater dispel magichas a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even ifdispel magiccan’t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse’s DC.\nArea Dispel: Whengreater dispel magicis used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted bydispel magic. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\nFor each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of thegreater dispel magicspell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of thegreater dispel magicspell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\nIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned bysummon monster) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.\nYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\nCounterspell: This functions asdispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.\nWhen used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell.

In the Dimension of Dreams, you move through a swirling sea of thoughts, desires, and emotions created by the minds of dreamers everywhere to reach your destination dreamscape. Reaching the destination dreamscape takes 1 hour. At any point before the spell’s duration ends, you can dismiss the spell to return to where you started on theMaterial Plane. The connection between dreams and reality is inherently tenuous, and your ability to arrive precisely where you mean to is dependent on your familiarity with the dreamer you’re trying to find. To determine how accurate your arrival is at the end of your dream travel, roll d% on the following table.\n“Very familiar” means that you have had contact usingdream, dream council, dream scan, or a similar spell within the past 24 hours with the creature whose dreamscape you are trying to locate.\n“Somewhat familiar” means that you have had contact with the dreaming character using one of those spells at least once in the past.\n“Known creature” means that while you know the creature whose dreamscape you’re trying to locate, you have not connected to its dreams with those spells.\n“Not well known” is a creature you have heard of, know by name and true identity, but have never met.\n“False identity” means that whether or not you have met the creature, you know it only through a false identity. When trying to locate the dreamscape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct dreamscape.\nOn Target: You travel to the correct creature’s current dreamscape.\nOff Target: You travel to an area near the target dreamscape on theEthereal Plane.\nOther Dreamscape: You travel to a similar creature’s dreamscape on the Dimension of Dreams.\nMishap: You and anyone else traveling with you experience a mishap during travel; each character takes 1d10 points of damage and must reroll on the table to see where it ends up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the travelers take more damage and must reroll to see where they end up.\nRegardless of the accuracy of your dream travel, you and your companions all arrive at the same location (except in the case of a mishap). Mindless creatures can’t use dream travel, nor can creatures that can’t dream.\nYou might be able to exit the dream near the creature on its home plane. If you and the other creatures are still in a dream when the dreamer wakes up, the dreamer can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another dreamscape or onto theEthereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the dreamer awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.\nYou can use dream travel to travel to the dream of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the dreams ofoutsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination dream, and each traveler must succeed at aWillsave each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomesshakenfor the remainder of the dream travel and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using dream travel to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply.\nTraveling to a differentplanardestination decreases the accuracy of your dream transit.

Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren’t inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to harmful emotion and fear effects.\nUnlike withdream travel, there is no chance the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However, if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you do need to roll, using the false identity entry fromdream travel.\nCreatures that disembark from your vehicle can either enter the dreamscape or exit to the plane where the dreamer’s body lies, arriving within 1 mile of the dreamer’s body. All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The dreamer can’t prevent the dream voyagers from entering its dream, but can attempt aWillsave to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.\nThe psychic vehicle remains in the dream for the remainder of the spell’s duration, even if it’s unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the dreamer can reenter the dream vessel as afull-round actionthrough an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast dream voyage to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the dream again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell’s duration. If the vessel moves out of a dreamscape, companions left behind can’t return to the vessel by being near the dreamer. If a companion is killed, its body doesn’t return to the dream voyage unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.\nIf the dreamer awakens while the dream vessel is still in its dream, it can allow the dream travelers to exit or not (as withdream travel). The dream vessel remains intact in the Dimension of Dreams for the spell’s duration even if it’s untethered from a dream. It drifts through dreams when this happens, and you can’t pilot it to another dream (even a dream of the initial dreamer if that creature begins dreaming again).

A combination of cultural importance, astral secrets, and constant practice allows shulsagas to push the spell’s magic beyond its normal limits. Masters of the art can perform truly extraordinary maneuvers with proper training. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (floating disk) feat to use the trick.\nDefensive Disk(Fly3 ranks,Shield Proficiency): While riding atop your floating disk with at least one hand free, you can spend amove actionto grip the disk by its edge, tilt it, and use it to deflect blows. Until the beginning of your next turn, your floating disk grants you the benefits of the spellshield. If you are already under the effects of the shield spell from another source, this effect instead increases the spell’sshield bonusby 1 until the beginning of your next turn.\nDisk Rider(Fly3 ranks): You can ride atop any floating disk you create, so long as it has the capacity to support your weight. This grants you a fly speed of 30 feet (average), but the disk cannot move itself or you more than 5 feet above the ground at any time. If you are on a location within theAstral Plane—the disk can instead fly to any height, and your fly speed while standing on it increases to 40 feet (good). When you cast floating disk, you can step onto the disk in your space as part of the action required to cast the spell.\nDrifting Defense(Fly6 ranks,Mobility,Shield Proficiency): Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you canactivatethe defensive disk trick as afree action.\nExpanded Disk(Fly3 ranks,Heighten Spell): If you are Large or larger, you can create a larger floating disk capable of supporting your weight and size; however, for each size category you are larger than Medium, you must use a spell slot that is one level higher (for example, a 4th-level spell is required to create a disk capable of supporting a Gargantuan creature).

It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.\nAgatehas a front and a back. Creatures moving through thegatefrom the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.\nPlanar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, agatespell functions much like aplane shiftspell, except that thegateopens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent agatefrom opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you–anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. Agatecannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.\nYou may hold thegateopen only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.\nCalling Creatures: The second effect of thegatespell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause thegateto open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through thegate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates agatethat remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.\nIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.\nIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see thelesser planar allyspell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward.

Any creature that bears the coin gains a bonus or penalty (decided by the caster at the time of casting) on allAppraise,Bluff,Craft, andProfessionchecks. This bonus or penalty is equal to 1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). In addition, the coin can produce an effect similar to the spellauguryonce per day—its ﬂip producing a weal (heads), woe (tails), or nothing result (landing on the edge). Potentially unknown to the bearer (if different from the caster), the caster can telepathically hear any question asked of the coin and, as afree action, influence the result as he chooses.\nMammon’s Mantle: Making a sacrifice worth 3,000 gp transforms the coin into a kind of infernal aegis for any who swallow the coin.

Additionally, the bearer can eat gold to heal himself, regaining 1 hit point for every 20 gold pieces he consumes (materials other than gold provide no beneﬁt). The coin’s effects last for 1 day per caster level.\nGold Guardian: Making a sacrifice worth 6,000 gp allows the focus coin to animate nearby coins. When cast into a pile of 100,000 coins, an animate hoard forms under the control of the caster. The guardian serves for 1 month. After this month, coins begin disappearing from the guardian at a rate of 100 gp per day, reducing the creature’s hit points by 1 per day. When the guardian’s hit points reach 0, the guardian collapses and the focus coin is destroyed.

You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make aCharismacheck opposed by the creature’sCharismacheck. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones re-offered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on theCharismacheck, the creature breaks free of the spell’s effect and can escape or attack you.\nOnce the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped).

While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while touching the living target with the focus item.

The disguise created by recorporeal incarnation lasts for a number of weeks equal to your caster level, or until the focus item is moved more than 30 feet away from the living target. When the effect ends, the living target returns to its normal form, sloughing off the corpse’s flesh.\nThe greatest strength of recorporeal incarnation is the difficulty of detecting it as a disguise. If subjected to detect magic, the living target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives off an aura of strong necromantic magic. True seeing does not reveal the living target’s true form, since the corpse’s flesh magically obscures it. The spell detect undead and similar effects indicate the living target is an undead creature, but the target is not truly undead, and is not affected by any other effects that target undead creatures. Recorporeal incarnation does not disguise the target’s alignment.\nIf the living target of recorporeal incarnation dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues. Any raise dead or similar spell cast upon that target resurrects that target, not the corpse flesh.

The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death.

A spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as asorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.\nIt’s possible for the change in the subject’s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.\nFor a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below. For non-humanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.\nA creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated.

If the target does not agree to all the conditions in the contract, this spell fails when cast. The contract (and this spell) automatically expires if you or the target dies. While the contract remains in effect, you gain a profane bonus to your Armor Class, saving throws, and checks equal to the highest- level spell you have imbued.\nOnce you cast this spell, you cannot prepare a new 5th-level spell to replace it until the contract expires. If the number of 5th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active lesser spellcasting contract spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.\nUnlike imbue with spell ability, how the target uses the spell has no refection on your alignment or relationship with Asmodeus; the Prince of Darkness accepts that allowing another access to his magic for good may benefit his plans in the long run.

Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell’s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSummon Monster II\nSchoolconjuration(summoning);Levelantipaladin2,bard2,cleric/oracle2,medium2,psychic2,sorcerer/wizard2,summoner/unchained summoner2,spiritualist2,witch2;Subdomaindark tapestry2;Elemental Schoolair2,earth2,fire2,water2\nThis spell functions likesummon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the2nd-level listor 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the1st-level list.\nSummon Monster III\nSchoolconjuration(summoning);Levelantipaladin3,bard3,cleric/oracle3,psychic3,sorcerer/wizard3,spiritualist3,witch3\nThis spell functions likesummon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the3rd-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the2nd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the1st-level list.\nSummon Monster IV\nSchoolconjuration(summoning);Levelantipaladin4,bard4,cleric/oracle4,medium3,psychic4,sorcerer/wizard4,spiritualist4,summoner/unchained summoner3,witch4;Elemental Schoolair4,earth4,fire4,water4\nThis spell functions likesummon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the4th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the3rd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSummon Monster V\nSchoolconjuration(summoning);Levelbard5,cleric/oracle5,medium4,psychic5,sorcerer/wizard5,spiritualist5,summoner/unchained summoner4,witch5;Domaindarkness5;Subdomaindark tapestry5;Elemental Schoolair5,earth5,fire5,water5\nThis spell functions likesummon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the5th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the4th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSummon Monster VI\nSchoolconjuration(summoning);Levelbard6,cleric/oracle6,psychic6,sorcerer/wizard6,spiritualist6,unchained summoner5,witch6;Elemental Schoolair6,earth6,fire6,water6\nThis spell functions likesummon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the6th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the5th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSummon Monster VII\nSchoolconjuration(summoning);Levelcleric/oracle7,psychic7,sorcerer/wizard7,summoner5,unchained summoner6,witch7;Bloodlineaquatic7;Elemental Schoolair7,earth7,fire7,water7\nThis spell functions likesummon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the7th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the6th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSummon Monster VIII\nSchoolconjuration(summoning);Levelcleric/oracle8,psychic8,sorcerer/wizard8,summoner6,witch8;Elemental Schoolair8,earth8,fire8,water8\nThis spell functions likesummon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the8th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the7th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSummon Monster IX\nSchoolconjuration(summoning);Levelcleric/oracle9,psychic9,sorcerer/wizard9,witch9;Domainchaos9,evil9,good9,law9;Bloodlineabyssal9\nThis spell functions likesummon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the9th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the8th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

When triggered, asymbol of deathkills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. Thesymbol of deathaffects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while thesymbol of deathis active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.\nUntil it is triggered, thesymbol of deathis inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, asymbol of deathmust always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders thesymbol of deathineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case thesymbol of deathworks normally.\nAs a default, asymbol of deathis triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, asymbol of death’striggering conditions cannot be changed.\nIn this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over asymbol of deathto render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can’t use asymbol of deathoffensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing thesymbol of deathis used to touch a creature. Likewise, asymbol of deathcannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\nYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering asymbol of deathcan be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don’t qualify.\nWhen scribing asymbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol’s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\nYou also can attune any number of creatures to thesymbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to asymbol of deathcannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your ownsymbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them."},{name:"Symbol of Debauchery",school:"enchantment",subschool:'<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a>',descripters:["emotion",'<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>'],description:""},{name:"Symbol of Dispelling",school:"abjuration;",description:""},{name:"Symbol of Distraction",school:"enchantment",subschool:'<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a>',descripters:['<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>'],description:"This spell functions likesymbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of a symbol of distraction instead becomefascinatedby the symbol for 10 minutes percaster level.

This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave’s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.\nWhen you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).\nThe wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even onedruidclass level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM’s discretion.\nThe wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave’s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.\nThe momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city)."},{name:"Wracking Ray",school:"necromancy",descripters:["evil","pain"],description:"A ray of sickly greenish-gray negative energy issues forth from the palm of your hand."},{name:"Wrath",school:"enchantment",subschool:"compulsion",descripters:["emotion",'<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>'],description:""},{name:"Wrathful Mantle",school:"evocation",descripters:["force","light"],description:""},{name:"Wrathful Weapon",school:"transmutation",descripters:["see text"],description:"You grant the targeted weapon one of the following weapon special abilities:anarchic,axiomatic,holy, orunholy.

This causes such creatures to seek to aid any obvious minions or worshipers of Hastur in sight, and any true worshiper of Hastur can command the affected creatures as if that worshiper had been the one to dominate them. In the case of conflicting commands issued from different true worshipers of Hastur, the commanders must attempt opposedCharismachecks, with the winner being able to command the targets for that round. If no worshipers or agents of Hastur are in sight, an affected creature can act normally. When affected by this spell’s Yellow Sign in this way, the effects last for 1 round per level. Once triggered, the Yellow Sign remains active for 10 minutes percaster level.\nThere is a 1% chance when a creature fails its saving throw against this spell that Hastur takes note and, for reasons of his own, decides to control the target personally. In this case, the actions taken by the dominated creature are left to the GM to determine, but the effects of this spell’s Yellow Sign persist for 1 day per level and the commands issued cannot be countermanded by any other creature, even if they are Hastur worshipers.\nRegardless of how long the effects last or whether Hastur directly controls a victim, if a creature failed to resist this spell’s effects, Hastur can target that victim for the rest of its life with his fulvous dreams ability.
