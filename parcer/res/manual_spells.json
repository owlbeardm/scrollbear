    "description": "This spell summons one or more vermin to investigate a single location or building you can see. Your scouts must spend 1d6 hours investigating the target location, but need no oversight. When done, they return unerringly to you with their findings, traveling up to 1 mile per caster level you have to rejoin their master. Each insect’s size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level, and can’t attack. Because of their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can attempt Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level.\n\nEach scout that returns passes along memories of specific structural flaws, defenses, and alarms, granting you the ability to reroll one failed skill check per scout, as long as the skill check involves that specific location’s layout, such as a Stealth check to sneak in, a Disable Device check to silence an alarm, or a Perception check to notice a trap. If even one scout returns, you also gain a rough understanding of the building’s layout (at least, any portions your scouts could access). All insight (and the associated rerolls) fades 1 hour per caster level you have after the scouts return. Your insects remember nothing about creatures, and so provide no information about guardians or any conversations they may overhear.\n"

Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact destination is otherwise random.

This spell has no effect if cast on the Material Plane, and it ends as soon as the spell’s target leaves the plane with which it has been infused. Details on planar infusions can be found in each plane’s Infusion section.  \n  \nOnce a creature gains the benefits of _bestow planar infusion I_, it remains attuned to that plane for 24 hours. Additional castings of _bestow planar infusion I_ during this time bestow the same infusion that was granted by the initial casting that day. Planar infusions that can be used a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by multiple castings of _bestow planar infusion I_."

While _shield of shards is active, you lose your shield’s bonus to AC as its broken pieces orbit you. On your turn, you can direct the shards to attack an adjacent opponent as a move action. The shards’ attack bonus is equal to your caster level + the modifier for the ability score that determines your spell save DCs. The shards deal an amount of slashing and piercing damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per shard beyond the first, and have a threat range of 19–20. They are considered magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Additionally, if your shield is made from a special material (such as adamantine), the shards penetrate damage reduction and hardness as if they were weapons made from the same material.  \n  \nAt the end of this spell’s duration, the shards reform into their original shield form. You regain its shield bonus to AC, provided you still have a free hand in which to wield it. Otherwise, the shield falls at your feet in your square."

The spiritual squire occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. While the spiritual squire appears to wear armor and carry a weapon, it cannot make attacks and does not threaten any spaces. On your turn, the spiritual squire can do one of the following: retrieve one stowed item from your possessions, carry an object weighing no more than 10 pounds per caster level, hand you an object it is carrying, perform the aid another action on your behalf or for one of your allies, or help one creature of your choice don armor (which then takes half the normal time). When the spiritual squire attempts the aid another action in combat, its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier.  \n  \nEach round after the first as a swift action, you can order the spiritual squire to move. It has a speed of 30 feet. Being a construct of force, the spiritual squire cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but _disintegrate, dispel magic, a _rod of cancellation, or a _sphere of annihilation affects it. A spiritual ally’s AC against touch attacks is 10."
